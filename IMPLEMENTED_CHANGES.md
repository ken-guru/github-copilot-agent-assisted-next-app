## Dark Theme Implementation (2024-01-24)

### Context
The application needed a comprehensive dark theme to reduce eye strain and provide better accessibility. This implementation showcases how to:
- Transform an existing light-themed application to support multiple themes
- Implement HSL-based color system with CSS variables
- Handle theme preferences with system detection

### Implementation Details
```markdown
1. Color System Implementation
   - Base HSL palette:
     ```css
     Background: hsl(220, 13%, 18%)
     Text: hsl(220, 13%, 95%)
     Accent: [hue-specific values]
     ```
   - Consistent hue values across themes
   - Variable saturation/lightness for variants
   - Status color adjustments for dark mode

2. CSS Architecture
   - Global CSS variables in :root
   - Theme-specific overrides
   - Transition handling
   - Component-specific adaptations

3. Theme Toggle Implementation
   - System preference detection
   - Manual override support
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - Smooth theme transitions

4. Component Updates
   - Color variable conversion
   - Dark theme testing
   - Accessibility verification
   - Shadow adjustments

5. Technical Implementation
   - CSS variable naming conventions
   - Theme transition system
   - SVG/asset handling
   - Test suite updates
```

### Testing Approach
```markdown
- Theme toggle functionality
- System preference handling
- LocalStorage persistence
- Component appearance in both themes
- Transition animations
- Accessibility compliance
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Theme switching working
- ✅ System preference detection functional
- ✅ Color contrast meeting WCAG guidelines
- ✅ Smooth transitions implemented

### Reference Implementation
This change can serve as a template for:
- Adding theme support to other applications
- Implementing HSL-based color systems
- Creating theme toggle functionality
- Handling system theme preferences
