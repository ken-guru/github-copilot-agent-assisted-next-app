## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure
- **Framework**: Cypress 14.5.4
- **Browser**: Electron 130 (headless)
- **Error Handling**: Hydration error suppression for Next.js
- **Viewport Testing**: Multiple mobile viewports (iPhone, Samsung)

### Helper Functions
- `setupActivitiesForTesting()`: Standardized test setup
- `getActivityNames()`: Activity order extraction
- Error handling for React hydration issues
- localStorage manipulation and verification

### Test Data Management
- Clean state initialization with localStorage.clear()
- Consistent activity naming for predictable testing
- Proper wait times for async operations

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Application State Management
- **Challenge**: Activities persisting between tests
- **Solution**: Comprehensive localStorage clearing in beforeEach

### 2. Timing Issues
- **Challenge**: Async operations and state updates
- **Solution**: Strategic wait times and proper element waiting

### 3. CSS Class Variations
- **Challenge**: Dynamic CSS class names in production
- **Solution**: Flexible selectors and attribute-based targeting

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Different browser behaviors
- **Solution**: Electron-based consistent testing environment

## Verification of Implementation Quality

### Code Coverage
- **Drag and Drop**: ✅ Comprehensive testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: ✅ Full key combination coverage
- **Accessibility**: ✅ ARIA and screen reader support
- **Mobile Support**: ✅ Touch events and responsive design
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Edge cases and failure scenarios
- **Performance**: ✅ Large datasets and rapid operations

### Requirements Traceability
Each test directly maps to specific requirements from the specification:
- Tests reference requirement numbers (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Full coverage of all specified requirements
- Verification of both functional and non-functional requirements

## Conclusion
