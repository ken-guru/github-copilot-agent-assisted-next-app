/**
 * End-to-end tests for complete activity reordering workflows
 * Tests drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation, persistence, and cross-view consistency
 * 
 * Note: This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for activity reordering functionality
 * including drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation, persistence, accessibility, and cross-view consistency.
 * 
 * The tests are designed to verify:
 * 1. Drag and drop reordering with visual feedback
 * 2. Keyboard navigation using Ctrl+Up/Down keys
 * 3. Order persistence across page reloads and browser sessions
 * 4. Cross-view consistency between Activities, Timer, and Summary views
 * 5. Accessibility features including ARIA attributes and screen reader support
 * 6. Mobile touch interactions (if implemented)
 * 7. Error handling and edge cases
 * 8. Performance with large activity lists
 * 
 * Requirements covered:
 * - 1.1, 1.2, 1.3: Drag and drop reordering functionality
 * - 2.1, 2.2, 2.3: Cross-view consistency
 * - 3.1, 3.2: Order persistence
 * - 4.1, 4.2: Accessibility features
 * - 6.1, 6.2: Mobile touch support (if implemented)
