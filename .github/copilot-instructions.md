# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**Note:** This file contains legacy protocols for testing, documentation, and memory log management. Some sections may be deprecated due to recent workflow changes, but the standards below remain a useful reference for code quality and process.

---

## Testing Protocols
- Always write tests before implementing functionality.
- Maintain thorough test coverage for all features and bug fixes.
- Use Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end tests.

## Documentation Standards
- Document all major code changes in the relevant markdown files.
- Use clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Update README.md and PLANNED_CHANGES.md as needed.

## Memory Log Protocols
- Log all significant architectural decisions in MEMORY_LOG.md.
- Use memory log mapping files for tracking changes and migrations.

## Code Quality Standards
- Enforce linting and type safety on all commits.
- Use relative import paths for consistency.
- Follow established naming conventions and file organization.
