# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## PREAMBLE
Streamlined guidelines for AI-assisted development of a **Next.js 15 + React 19 + Bootstrap 5 + TypeScript** activity tracking application. Focus on GitHub issue resolution using MCP tools.

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE ESSENTIALS

### Core Patterns
```typescript
// Activity State Machine: PENDING â†’ RUNNING â†’ COMPLETED/REMOVED
// Only ONE activity can be RUNNING at a time
// Located: src/utils/activityStateMachine.ts

// Hook Architecture:
useActivityState (main orchestrator)
â”œâ”€â”€ useActivitiesTracking (state machine wrapper)
â””â”€â”€ useTimelineEntries (timeline management)

// Theme System: CSS Variables + Bootstrap data-bs-theme
// Light/Dark/System modes with localStorage persistence
// Located: src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx
```

### Key Files
```
src/hooks/useActivityState.ts      # Main state orchestrator
src/utils/activityStateMachine.ts  # Business logic core
src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx      # Theme management
src/components/                    # Bootstrap-wrapped components
```

### Test Architecture
- **85% Jest** (component logic, hooks, utilities) - 15x faster
- **15% Cypress** (complete user workflows only)
- **Test-First Development**: Write Jest tests BEFORE implementation

## GITHUB ISSUE RESOLUTION WORKFLOW

### CRITICAL: Branch Protection Rules
- **NEVER commit directly to main** - branch is protected
- **ALWAYS create feature branch**: `fix-<issue-number>-<brief-description>`
- **Create PRs into main** - all changes require PR reviews
- **IMPORTANT: When already working on an existing PR branch, do NOT create a new branch or PR. Continue committing to the current PR branch and update the existing PR.**

### Complete Issue Resolution Process
**ðŸ“š Detailed Workflow**: [/docs/workflows/github-issue-resolution.md](../docs/workflows/github-issue-resolution.md)

1. **Analyze Issue** â†’ Use GitHub MCP tools + Sequential Thinking
2. **Verify Problem** â†’ Use Playwright MCP tools for UI issues  
3. **Create Branch** â†’ Never work on main directly. If a PR already exists for the task and you're on its branch, continue on that same branch (do not create a new branch/PR).
4. **Implement Solution** â†’ Test-first development with Jest
5. **Quality Checks** â†’ All tests, lint, type-check must pass
6. **Create PR** â†’ Good title/description referencing issue
7. **Monitor & Iterate** â†’ Address CI/CD failures and code review comments
8. **Complete Verification** â†’ **NEVER consider work finished until ALL PR checks pass**
9. **Existing PR Continuation** â†’ When changes are requested on an open PR, push additional commits to the same branch and update the PR description/comments as needed. Do not open a new PR for the same task.

### Issue Understanding with MCP Tools
```bash
# Get issue details
mcp_github_get_issue(issue_number=<NUMBER>)
mcp_github_get_issue_comments(issue_number=<NUMBER>)

# Complex analysis
mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Breaking down this issue: components affected, user impact, root cause..."
})

# Search historical solutions
mcp_memory_search_nodes(query="similar issue keywords")
```

### Issue Verification (UI/UX Issues)
```bash
# Navigate and reproduce (use network IP, not localhost, for MCP Playwright tools)
mcp_playwright_browser_navigate(url="http://192.168.86.30:3000")
mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot()
mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot(filename="issue-<NUMBER>-current-state.png")
```

> Important: MCP Playwright sessions cannot access localhost/127.0.0.1. Use your machine's LAN IP (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:3000). On macOS you can find it via System Settings â†’ Network or with `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (Wiâ€‘Fi) / `ipconfig getifaddr en1` (Ethernet).

### Session Sharing Verification Addendum

- User flows to verify:
  - Create share from Summary â†’ receive absolute `shareUrl`
  - Open `/shared/[id]` and confirm theme-aware color normalization
  - Download JSON and re-import via Replace; ensure descriptions and colors preserved
- Privacy & safety checks:
  - No PII in shared payloads; no `colorIndex`
  - Logs must not contain tokens or secrets
- Testing constraints:
  - Jest tests must not hit Vercel endpoints; rely on local fallback/mocks
  - Prefer server-provided `shareUrl`; only use SSR-safe `window.origin` when needed

## MCP TOOL INTEGRATION

### Available Tools and Documentation
- **GitHub**: [github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) - Issue/PR management
- **Sequential Thinking**: [sequentialthinking](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) - Complex problem analysis
- **Memory**: [memory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) - Knowledge persistence
- **Time**: [time](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time) - Timezone handling
- **Playwright**: [mcp-playwright](https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright) - Browser automation

```

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### Issue Resolution Continuity
**NEVER identify an issue and forget to resolve it after committing.**
- Explicitly state next actions before committing
- Continue immediately after commit with identified issues
- Document unresolved issues in commit messages

### PR Completion Requirements
**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NEVER consider work finished until ALL PR checks pass.**
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline status continuously
- Address all failing tests, linting errors, and type-check failures
- Respond to all code review comments before marking work complete
- **MANDATORY GitHub Copilot Review Protocol**: If you request a GitHub Copilot code review, you MUST wait for the review comments and address ALL unresolved feedback before considering work complete
- Use MCP GitHub tools to track PR status and check completion
- Work remains incomplete until all automated and manual checks succeed

#### GitHub Copilot Code Review Workflow
When a GitHub Copilot code review is requested:
1. **Request Review**: Create PR and request GitHub Copilot review
2. **WAIT**: Do not mark work complete until review comments arrive
3. **Address UNRESOLVED Feedback**: Systematically respond to unresolved review comments only
   - Use `mcp_github_get_pull_request_comments` to retrieve all feedback
   - **CRITICAL**: Only address comments that are NOT already resolved on GitHub
   - **SKIP**: Comments marked as "Resolved" or "Outdated" on GitHub do not need re-addressing
   - Address code quality suggestions, optimization recommendations, and best practice improvements for unresolved comments only
   - Make all requested changes for unresolved feedback and verify they don't break existing functionality
4. **Validate Changes**: Run full test suite after addressing unresolved feedback
5. **Complete**: Only after ALL unresolved review feedback is addressed and validated can work be considered finished

### Quality Gates (All Must Pass)
```bash
npm test                    # All Jest tests
npm run lint               # ESLint compliance  
npm run type-check         # TypeScript validation
npm run build              # Build verification
npm run cypress:run        # E2E tests (if workflow changes)
```

### Security Requirements
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Never expose local filesystem paths or external structure
- Repository-relative paths only
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

## TESTING PROTOCOLS

### Jest vs Cypress Decision Matrix
**Use Jest for**: Component logic, hooks, utilities, accessibility, theme switching, form validation, error handling

**Use Cypress for**: Complete user workflows spanning multiple pages, file operations, service worker UI interactions

## IMMEDIATE ACTION CHECKLIST

When given a GitHub issue number:
1. âœ… **Analyze**: Use GitHub MCP tools to understand issue and comments
2. âœ… **Think**: Use Sequential Thinking for complex problems  
3. âœ… **Search**: Check Memory Tool for similar historical solutions
4. âœ… **Verify**: Use Playwright tools for UI/UX issues
5. âœ… **Branch**: Create feature branch (never work on main)
6. âœ… **Implement**: Write tests first, then implement solution
7. âœ… **Quality**: Pass all quality gates before pushing
8. âœ… **PR**: Create PR with clear title/description referencing issue
9. âœ… **Monitor**: Watch CI/CD and address code review comments iteratively
10. âœ… **Complete GitHub Copilot Review**: If GitHub Copilot review requested, WAIT for feedback and address ALL unresolved comments
11. âœ… **Document**: Update memory logs and planning documents

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: If you request a GitHub Copilot code review, you MUST wait for the review comments and address ALL unresolved feedback before considering the work finished. The goal is complete issue resolution with all quality checks passed, not just implementation.
