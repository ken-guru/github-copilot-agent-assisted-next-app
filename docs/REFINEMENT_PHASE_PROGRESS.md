# Refinement Phase Implementation Progress

This document tracks the detailed progress of the Refinement Phase tasks, focusing on performance optimizations, advanced interactions, testing, and final polish.

## Current Focus: Performance Optimizations

### 1. Component Lazy Loading

| Subtask | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Identify non-critical components | üîÑ In Progress | Analyzing component usage patterns |
| Set up code splitting with dynamic imports | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will use Next.js dynamic import |
| Create loading states for lazy components | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Design needed for placeholders |
| Measure and document loading improvements | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will use performanceMetrics utility |

### 2. Rendering Performance

| Subtask | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Audit component re-renders | üîÑ In Progress | Using React DevTools profiler |
| Fix hydration mismatches | üîÑ In Progress | Theme synchronization implemented |
| Implement memoization for expensive components | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will use React.memo and useMemo |
| Apply virtualization for long lists | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Researching best virtualization library |

### 3. Asset Optimization

| Subtask | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Optimize image loading strategy | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will use next/image with priority |
| Implement font optimization | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will use font-display: swap |
| Add resource hints for critical paths | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Preconnect and preload for key resources |

### 4. Network Optimization

| Subtask | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Implement request caching | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Using SWR for data fetching |
| Enhance offline capabilities | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Will implement service worker |
| Add prefetching for likely user paths | ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started | Needs navigation analysis |

## Performance Benchmarks

We've established the following baseline metrics:

| Metric | Current | Target | Progress |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| First Contentful Paint | 1.8s | < 1.0s | 0% |
| Time to Interactive | 3.2s | < 2.0s | 0% |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 2.4s | < 2.0s | 0% |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | 0.12 | < 0.1 | 0% |
| Long Tasks (>50ms) | 5 | < 2 | 0% |
| JS Bundle Size | 245KB | < 200KB | 0% |

## Recent Fixes

### Theme Synchronization for Hydration Mismatch

We identified and fixed hydration mismatches between server and client rendering:
- Created a theme synchronization utility that ensures consistent theme variables
- Implemented early theme detection before hydration
- Fixed style property format issues (kebab-case vs. camelCase)
- Added comprehensive tests for theme synchronization

### Performance Monitoring Setup

We've implemented basic performance monitoring capabilities:
- Component render time tracking
- Interaction response time measurement
- Long task detection
- First Input Delay monitoring
- Performance reporting utilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete the hydration mismatch fixes and verify across different themes
2. Continue with component lazy loading implementation
3. Begin the rendering performance optimization tasks
4. Set up automated performance testing with Lighthouse CI

## Blockers / Issues

- None currently

## Notes

- Performance optimization work should preserve accessibility features
- All optimizations require before/after benchmarks
- Document any tradeoffs made for performance gains
