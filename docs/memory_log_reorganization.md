# Memory Log Reorganization

This document explains the memory log reorganization that was performed to improve organization and maintainability of the memory logs.

## Overview

The memory log system was reorganized to implement a category-based sequential numbering system. The reorganization included:

1. Categorizing all memory logs by topic (service-worker, testing, ui-layout, etc.)
2. Assigning new sequential IDs within each category
3. Standardizing naming conventions
4. Creating a comprehensive index
5. Handling duplicate descriptive names

## Implementation Details

### Categorization

Memory logs were categorized based on their content into these categories:

- Service Worker
- Testing
- UI Layout
- Dark Mode
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Deployment
- Miscellaneous

### ID Assignment

Each file received a new ID formatted as `MRTMLY-XXX` where XXX is a sequential number with leading zeros. 
IDs were assigned sequentially within each category to keep related entries together.

### Handling Duplicates

Files with identical descriptive names were handled through a special naming convention:
- The first occurrence received an `-original` suffix
- Subsequent occurrences received `-variation-N` suffixes where N is a sequential number

### Reference Updates

All references to memory logs in other documentation files were automatically updated to use the new filenames.

## Files Involved

- `reorganize-memory-logs.js`: The primary script that performed the reorganization
- `test-memory-log-reorganization.js`: A test script that validated the reorganization logic
- `memory_log_mapping.json`: A mapping file that records the relationship between old and new filenames

## Mapping Reference

A complete mapping of old filenames to new filenames is stored in `docs/memory_log_mapping.json`. This file serves as a historical reference and can be used to track the history of any memory log entry.

## Future Memory Log Creation

New memory logs should follow the established pattern:

1. Use the next available sequential ID in the appropriate category
2. Follow the naming format: `MRTMLY-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
3. Add a reference link to the memory log in the appropriate category section in `MEMORY_LOG.md`
