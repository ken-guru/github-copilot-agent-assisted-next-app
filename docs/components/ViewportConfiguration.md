# Viewport Configuration

This document details the viewport configuration for Mr. Timely and explains how mobile zooming and panning is handled.

## Overview
The viewport configuration in Next.js controls how the application is displayed on different devices, particularly for mobile responsiveness. In Mr. Timely, we've configured specific viewport settings to ensure consistent user experience across devices.

## Configuration Details

### Basic Configuration
- `width: 'device-width'`: Ensures the width matches the screen size of the device
- `initialScale: 1`: Sets the initial zoom level to 100%
- `themeColor: '#000000'`: Sets the theme color for browser UI elements

### Mobile Zoom/Pan Settings
- `userScalable: false`: Prevents users from zooming in/out using gestures
- `maximumScale: 1`: Limits maximum zoom level to 100% (no zooming)

## Implementation

The viewport configuration is defined in `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  width: 'device-width',
  initialScale: 1,
  themeColor: '#000000',
  userScalable: false,
  maximumScale: 1,
};
```

## Accessibility Considerations

While disabling zoom and pan improves the general user experience by preventing accidental zooming, it's important to consider:

1. **Text Size**: All text should be sufficiently large (minimum 16px) to ensure readability
2. **Color Contrast**: Maintain WCAG 2.0 AA standards for color contrast
3. **Alternative Methods**: Consider alternative methods for users who may need zoom functionality

## Test Coverage

The viewport configuration is tested in `__tests__/layout/layout.test.tsx`:

- Basic viewport properties (width, initialScale)
- Mobile zoom/pan prevention properties (userScalable, maximumScale)
- Theme color configuration

## Known Limitations

- Disabling zoom may impact users with visual impairments who rely on zoom functionality
- Some mobile browsers may still allow zooming despite these settings
- The configuration applies globally and cannot be toggled by user preference
