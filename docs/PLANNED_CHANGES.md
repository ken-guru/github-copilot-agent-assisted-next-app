# Planned Changes Prompt Template
This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation. Once implemented, move the change to IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template
```markdown
# Feature/Change Title

## Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Which components/utilities are involved?
- What current behavior needs to change?
- What user needs does this address?

## Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. First requirement
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Testing requirements
2. Second requirement
   - Sub-points
   - Edge cases to handle
3. Additional requirements as needed

## Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Theme compatibility requirements
- Testing approach

## Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective
- Technical perspective
- Testing criteria

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases written
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

Note: When implementing a change, copy this template and fill it out completely. The more detailed the prompt, the better the AI assistance will be in implementation.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Planned Changes - Code Refactoring for Large Files

## Overview

To reduce AI model token consumption and improve code maintainability, we need to refactor files exceeding 200 lines. This document outlines the files that need refactoring and proposes strategies based on file types.

## Service Worker Registration Refactoring - Detailed Plan

Having completed the TypeScript errors fixing and file structure analysis, we're now progressing with the following phases:

### 1. Testing Phase (Current) - ETA: 3 days
- [ ] Review existing test coverage for service worker registration
- [ ] Identify untested functionality in the current implementation
- [ ] Create additional tests for:
  - [ ] Core registration process
  - [ ] Update detection and handling
  - [ ] Error scenarios and recovery
  - [ ] Network status change handling
  - [ ] Retry mechanisms with different timing scenarios
- [ ] Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on implementation details
- [ ] Document test coverage metrics before refactoring

### 2. Structure Creation Phase - ETA: 1 day
- [ ] Create directory structure:
  ```
  /src/utils/serviceWorker/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ updates.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ errors.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ retry.ts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
  ```
- [ ] Create initial type definitions in `types.ts`
- [ ] Setup barrel file (`index.ts`) with placeholder exports

### 3. Code Extraction Phase - ETA: 5 days
- [ ] Extract core registration logic to `core.ts`
  - [ ] Function: `register(config)`
  - [ ] Function: `unregister()`
  - [ ] Basic registration validity checks
- [ ] Extract update handling to `updates.ts`
  - [ ] Function: `onUpdate(registration, config)`
  - [ ] Function: `checkForUpdates(registration)`
  - [ ] Update notification logic
- [ ] Extract error handling to `errors.ts`
  - [ ] Function: `handleRegistrationError(error, config)`
  - [ ] Function: `logServiceWorkerErrors()`
- [ ] Extract network detection to `network.ts`
  - [ ] Function: `setupNetworkStatusListeners()`
  - [ ] Function: `handleNetworkStatusChange()`
- [ ] Extract retry mechanisms to `retry.ts`
  - [ ] Function: `setupRetryMechanism(registration, config)`
  - [ ] Function: `calculateRetryDelay(attempt)`

### 4. Integration Phase - ETA: 2 days
- [ ] Update barrel file to export all functionality
- [ ] Transform original `serviceWorkerRegistration.ts` to:
  - [ ] Re-export all functionality from the new structure
  - [ ] Add deprecation notices with migration guidance
  - [ ] Ensure full backward compatibility
- [ ] Update any direct imports in the codebase
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with the new structure

### 5. Documentation Phase - ETA: 1 day
- [ ] Create Memory Log entry documenting the refactoring process
- [ ] Document key decisions made during the refactoring
- [ ] Update API documentation for the service worker utilities
- [ ] Create usage examples for the new module structure

### 6. Final Review - ETA: 1 day
- [ ] Review bundle size impact
- [ ] Verify runtime performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Check for any regressions in service worker functionality
- [ ] Update progress tracker in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
- [ ] Mark as completed in IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with timestamp

## Next Target after Service Worker Refactoring

Once the service worker registration refactoring is complete, we will proceed with:

1. `/public/service-worker.js` refactoring
   - Will build upon lessons learned from the registration refactoring
   - Will focus on separating cache strategies from lifecycle management
   - Target completion: Within 7 days of completing the registration refactoring

2. Begin preparing for `ActivityManager.tsx` refactoring
   - Will conduct preliminary analysis while service worker refactoring is in progress
   - Will focus on extracting state management from UI rendering
