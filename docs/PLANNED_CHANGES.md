# Planned Changes Prompt Template
This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation. Once implemented, move the change to IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template
```markdown
# Feature/Change Title

## Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Which components/utilities are involved?
- What current behavior needs to change?
- What user needs does this address?

## Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. First requirement
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Testing requirements
2. Second requirement
   - Sub-points
   - Edge cases to handle
3. Additional requirements as needed

## Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Theme compatibility requirements
- Testing approach

## Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective
- Technical perspective
- Testing criteria

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases written
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

Note: When implementing a change, copy this template and fill it out completely. The more detailed the prompt, the better the AI assistance will be in implementation.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes
