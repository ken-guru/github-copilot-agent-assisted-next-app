# Planned Changes Prompt Template
This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation. Once implemented, move the change to IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template
```markdown
# Feature/Change Title

## Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Which components/utilities are involved?
- What current behavior needs to change?
- What user needs does this address?

## Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. First requirement
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Testing requirements
2. Second requirement
   - Sub-points
   - Edge cases to handle
3. Additional requirements as needed

## Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Theme compatibility requirements
- Testing approach

## Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective
- Technical perspective
- Testing criteria

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases written
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

Note: When implementing a change, copy this template and fill it out completely. The more detailed the prompt, the better the AI assistance will be in implementation.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Planned Changes - Code Refactoring for Large Files

## Overview

To reduce AI model token consumption and improve code maintainability, we need to refactor files exceeding 200 lines. This document outlines the files that need refactoring and proposes strategies based on file types.

## Session Summary and Next Steps

### Completed Items
- ‚úÖ Service Worker Registration refactoring (`/src/utils/serviceWorkerRegistration.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Service Worker file refactoring (`/public/service-worker.js`)
- ‚úÖ NextJS Configuration updates (`/next.config.js`)
- ‚úÖ Time Utilities refactoring (`/src/utils/timeUtils.ts`)

### Current Progress
- üîÑ ActivityManager refactoring - Analysis phase (30% complete)

### Next Session Tasks
When resuming this refactoring work, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Complete ActivityManager Analysis**
   - Document current behavior and test coverage
   - Create detailed test plan for the new structure
   - Identify all components and hooks that will interact with the refactored code

2. **Test Creation**
   - Begin with the testing preparation phase
   - Create comprehensive tests for both existing and new functionality
   - Ensure tests are isolated from implementation details

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with the `useActivityManagerState.ts` hook for state management
   - Then implement the `ActivityManagerCore.tsx` component
   - Follow with UI components that use the hook and core component
   - Finally update the main `ActivityManager.tsx` to use the new structure

4. **Scheduling Recommendation**
   - Allocate 1-2 hour sessions to tackle one phase at a time
   - Schedule separate sessions for test creation and implementation
   - Plan for documentation updates after implementation is complete

### Reference Information for Next Session
- The original `ActivityManager.tsx` contains approximately 250 lines of code
- Primary concerns are state management, UI rendering, and event handling
- Several component-specific hooks may need to be created or refactored
- Theme integration spans multiple aspects of the component
- Existing tests will need to be updated to reflect the new structure
