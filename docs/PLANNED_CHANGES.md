# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Mobile UI Improvements

## Context
The current UI works on mobile devices but is not optimized for touch interactions or smaller screens. When users enter overtime, there's no clear indication. The visual structure needs improvement to better organize content on mobile devices.

## Requirements
1. Touch-friendly UI elements
   - Minimum touch target size of 44px
   - Proper spacing between interactive elements
   - Optimized touch feedback (visual indicators)
   - Use CSS variables for consistent scaling
   
2. Overtime indication
   - Clear visual feedback when user enters overtime
   - Formatted display of overtime duration
   - Animation to draw attention without being distracting
   - Accessibility considerations for all users
   
3. Improved visual structure
   - Reorganize layout into clear semantic sections:
     - Header with logo and theme switcher
     - Main content with components for different states
     - Footer with primary actions
   - Ensure proper hierarchy and focus on current task
   - Apply consistent spacing and component sizing

## Technical Guidelines
- Use the `useViewport` hook for responsive behavior detection
- Leverage CSS modules with mobile-specific classes
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Implement performant animations using CSS transitions
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Add touch gesture support where appropriate
