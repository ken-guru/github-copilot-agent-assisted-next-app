# Planned Changes

This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation following the template in `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`.

Once implemented, move the change to `IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md` with a timestamp.

## Update Documentation to Use MCP Tools (Issue #233)

### Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Documentation files and AI agent guidelines need updating to reflect the use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools
- Current documentation doesn't mention MCP tools or provide guidance on their usage
- AI agents working on this project need clear instructions on when and how to use available MCP tools
- Affects primarily the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and potentially other documentation files

### Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. Update AI agent instructions to include MCP tool usage guidelines
   - Add section for MCP tool usage protocols
   - Document the three main MCP tools being used:
     - Memory tool (knowledge graph management)
     - Sequential thinking tool (step-by-step problem analysis)
     - Time tool (timezone-aware time handling)
   - Include when and how to use each tool effectively
   - Provide examples of tool combinations and workflows

2. Review and update other documentation files that reference AI agents
   - Check README.md for any AI agent references
   - Update component documentation templates if needed
   - Ensure Memory Log protocols align with MCP memory tool usage
   - Update debugging templates to incorporate MCP tools

3. Add protocols for handling tool availability
   - Guidelines for when tools are not available
   - Fallback strategies
   - Documentation of enhanced capabilities when tools are present

### Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations: None (documentation only)
- Performance requirements: None (documentation only)
- Accessibility requirements: Ensure documentation is clear and well-structured
- Theme compatibility requirements: Not applicable
- Testing approach: Manual review of documentation clarity and completeness

### Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective: AI agents will have clear guidance on using MCP tools to enhance development workflows
- Technical perspective: Documentation accurately reflects current tooling capabilities and usage patterns
- Testing criteria: Documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and follows established formatting standards

### Validation Criteria
- [x] Test cases written (N/A for documentation)
- [x] Implementation complete (all documentation updated)
- [x] Tests passing (N/A for documentation)
- [x] Theme compatibility verified (N/A for documentation)
- [x] Documentation updated (primary deliverable)
- [x] MCP tool usage guidelines added to copilot instructions
- [x] All three MCP tools (memory, sequential thinking, time) documented
- [x] Tool combination strategies documented
- [x] Fallback protocols documented
- [x] Examples and use cases provided
- [x] README.md updated with MCP tool information
- [x] Templates documentation enhanced with MCP tool integration
- [x] Debugging template updated to reference MCP tools

## Change Request Template Reference

For new feature requests, copy and use the complete template from:
- `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`

The template includes all required sections:
- Context (components affected, current behavior, user needs)
- Requirements (detailed specifications with implementation details)
- Technical Guidelines (framework considerations, performance, accessibility)
- Expected Outcome (success criteria from user and technical perspectives)
- Validation Criteria (checklist for completion verification)

**Note:** Always use the complete template structure - never create partial specifications. Ask clarifying questions if template sections cannot be completed fully before proceeding with implementation.
