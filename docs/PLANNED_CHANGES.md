# Planned Changes

This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation following the template in `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`.

Once implemented, move the change to `IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md` with a timestamp.

## Memory Log Migration to MCP Memory Tool (Issue #233 Extension)

### Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Current memory log system uses markdown files in `docs/logged_memories/` with 215+ entries
- Each entry follows structured format: Date, Tags, Status, Initial State, Debug Process, Resolution, Lessons Learned
- Current system requires manual browsing and searching through markdown files
- MCP Memory Tool provides AI-agent friendly knowledge graph storage with semantic search
- Migration would enable better AI assistance by making historical debugging knowledge queryable
- Affects memory log workflow, AI agent capabilities, and institutional knowledge preservation

### Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. **Phase 1: Proof of Concept and Parallel System**
   - ✅ Test MCP memory tool availability and basic operations
   - ✅ Create sample entity structure for debugging sessions, components, technologies
   - ✅ Migrate 2-3 memory log entries to validate data structure and search capabilities
   - ✅ Verify semantic search works effectively for AI agent queries
   - Create migration script to parse existing memory log markdown files
   - Extract structured data: title, date, tags, status, problems, resolutions, lessons

2. **Phase 2: Systematic Migration**
   - Migrate all 215+ memory log entries to MCP memory tool
   - Create entities for debug_session, component, technology, issue_type, resolution_pattern
   - Establish relations between debugging sessions and related components/technologies
   - Preserve original markdown files as backup and human-readable archive
   - Create export mechanism for backup/version control

3. **Phase 3: Documentation and Process Updates**
   - Update copilot-instructions.md to recommend MCP tool for new debugging sessions
   - Document hybrid approach: MCP for AI queries, markdown for detailed human reference
   - Create guidelines for when to use each system
   - Update debugging template to include MCP memory operations

### Technical Guidelines
- **Data Preservation**: No loss of existing memory log information during migration
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain original markdown files as authoritative source during transition
- **Search Optimization**: Structure entities and observations for effective semantic search
- **Relation Mapping**: Create meaningful relationships between debugging sessions, components, issues
- **Export Capabilities**: Ensure MCP data can be exported for backup/version control

### Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- **AI Agent Perspective**: Easy programmatic access to project debugging history through semantic search
- **Human Perspective**: Preserved access to detailed debugging information in readable format
- **Knowledge Building**: Enhanced institutional knowledge through connected debugging patterns
- **Development Efficiency**: Faster resolution of similar issues through better knowledge discovery

### Validation Criteria
- [x] **POC Completed**: MCP memory tool tested and 2 sample entries migrated successfully
- [x] **Search Validation**: Semantic search returns relevant debugging sessions for test queries
- [x] **Data Structure**: Entity/observation structure preserves key information from markdown logs  
- [x] **Relations Working**: Connections between debug sessions, components, and technologies established
- [x] **Migration Script**: Automated script to parse and migrate all existing memory log entries
- [x] **Manual Migration POC**: Successfully migrated MRTMLY-001 and MRTMLY-002 with full entity/relation structure
- [x] **Search Performance Validation**: AI agents can effectively find relevant debugging information using semantic search
- [ ] **Full Automated Migration**: All 215+ entries successfully migrated to MCP memory tool using script
- [ ] **Backup System**: Original markdown files preserved and export mechanism created
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Copilot instructions and debugging templates updated for hybrid approach
- [ ] **Final Validation Testing**: Complete validation that AI agents can successfully use MCP memory tool for debugging assistance

## Change Request Template Reference

For new feature requests, copy and use the complete template from:
- `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`

The template includes all required sections:
- Context (components affected, current behavior, user needs)
- Requirements (detailed specifications with implementation details)
- Technical Guidelines (framework considerations, performance, accessibility)
- Expected Outcome (success criteria from user and technical perspectives)
- Validation Criteria (checklist for completion verification)

**Note:** Always use the complete template structure - never create partial specifications. Ask clarifying questions if template sections cannot be completed fully before proceeding with implementation.
