# Planned Changes

This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation following the template in `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`.

Once implemented, move the change to `IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md` with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template Reference

For new feature requests, copy and use the complete template from:
- `docs/templates/PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md`

The template includes all required sections:
- Context (components affected, current behavior, user needs)
- Requirements (detailed specifications with implementation details)
- Technical Guidelines (framework considerations, performance, accessibility)
- Expected Outcome (success criteria from user and technical perspectives)
- Validation Criteria (checklist for completion verification)

**Note:** Always use the complete template structure - never create partial specifications. Ask clarifying questions if template sections cannot be completed fully before proceeding with implementation.
