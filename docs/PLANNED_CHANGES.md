## Material 3 Expressive Redesign (Comprehensive Visual System Transformation)

### Context
This represents a complete visual transformation of Mr. Timely from its current Bootstrap-based interface to Google's Material 3 Expressive design system. This is purely a visual and interaction design effort - no application logic, data handling, or core functionality will be modified.

The redesign addresses 7 core requirement areas:
1. **Material 3 Expressive Visual System**: Typography scale, shape language, dynamic color, motion principles
2. **Component System**: Buttons, cards, inputs, navigation with Material 3 styling and interactions  
3. **Typography & Spacing**: Dynamic type scale, expressive hierarchy, organic rhythm
4. **Interaction Design**: Hover effects, click feedback, keyboard navigation, micro-interactions
