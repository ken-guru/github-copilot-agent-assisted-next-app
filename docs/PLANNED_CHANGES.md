## Current Planned Changes

# Bootstrap Component Migration

## Context
This change affects the entire UI component library of the application. Currently, the application uses custom/local UI components with CSS modules for styling throughout the codebase. The components that need to be replaced include:

**Current Custom Components:**
- `ActivityButton` - Activity selection and status display buttons
- `ActivityForm` - Form for adding new activities
- `ActivityManager` - Container and management for activities
- `ConfirmationDialog` - Modal dialog for confirmations
- `ProgressBar` - Progress visualization component
- `Summary` - Statistics and summary display cards
- `ThemeToggle` - Theme selection toggle buttons
- `TimeDisplay` - Time and date display components
- `TimeSetup` - Time configuration form
- `Timeline` - Timeline visualization component
- `OfflineIndicator` - Offline status notification
- `ServiceWorkerUpdater` - Update notification component
- `UpdateNotification` - General notification component

**Current Behavior:** Each component uses custom CSS modules with custom styling, spacing systems, and design patterns.

**User Needs:** This migration aims to standardize the UI, improve maintainability, reduce custom CSS, and leverage Bootstrap's well-tested component library for better consistency and accessibility.

## Requirements

1. **Bootstrap Setup and Configuration** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Install Bootstrap 5.x and react-bootstrap packages (react-bootstrap@2.10.10 and bootstrap@5.3.7)
   - âœ… Configure Bootstrap CSS integration with Next.js
   - âœ… Use Bootstrap's default styling and theming system
   - âœ… Defer custom theme integration for future consideration
   - âœ… Testing: Verify Bootstrap loads correctly with default styles

2. **Component Inventory and Mapping** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Create comprehensive checklist of all custom UI components
   - âœ… Map each custom component to appropriate Bootstrap equivalent:
     - `ActivityButton` â†’ Bootstrap `Button` with custom variants
     - `ConfirmationDialog` â†’ Bootstrap `Modal`
     - `ProgressBar` â†’ Bootstrap `ProgressBar`
     - `ThemeToggle` â†’ Bootstrap `ButtonGroup` or `ToggleButton`
     - `ActivityForm`/`TimeSetup` â†’ Bootstrap `Form`, `FormControl`, `InputGroup`
     - Cards and containers â†’ Bootstrap `Card`, `Container`, `Row`, `Col`
   - âœ… Identify components that need custom wrapper components
   - âœ… Document any Bootstrap gaps that require alternative solutions
   - âœ… Testing: Validate mapping decisions with UI mockups

3. **Test-First Migration Strategy**
   - Write/update tests for each component before refactoring
   - Ensure tests cover current behaviors, edge cases, and accessibility
   - Update test expectations to accommodate Bootstrap-specific props and behaviors
   - Test for visual regression and UI consistency during migration
   - Testing: All component tests must pass before and after migration

4. **Iterative Component Replacement**
   - Replace components one at a time or in small logical groups
   - For each component:
     - Refactor to use Bootstrap component instead of custom implementation
     - Remove custom CSS modules where Bootstrap handles styling
     - Update component interfaces to use Bootstrap props
     - Preserve existing functionality and accessibility features
     - Update associated tests to work with new Bootstrap implementation
   - Limit each commit to maximum 5 files unless tightly coupled
   - Testing: Manual verification after each component replacement

5. **Theme Integration and Customization**
   - Use Bootstrap's default theme and color system initially
   - Phase out custom CSS properties in favor of Bootstrap's design tokens
   - Consider future Bootstrap theme customization to match brand colors
   - Maintain light/dark mode support using Bootstrap's dark mode features (data-bs-theme)
   - Handle transition from custom CSS variables to Bootstrap's approach
   - Testing: Verify default Bootstrap styling works correctly

6. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Update component documentation to reflect Bootstrap usage patterns
   - Remove unused custom CSS modules and related files
   - Update import statements and component usage throughout codebase
   - Document any Bootstrap-specific patterns or customizations needed
   - Log challenges, workarounds, and decisions in Memory Log
   - Testing: Documentation examples must work correctly

## Technical Guidelines

- **Official Documentation**: Always refer to official documentation for best practices:
  - React Bootstrap: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction
  - Bootstrap 5.3: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
- **Package Versions**: Using bootstrap@5.3.7 and react-bootstrap@2.10.10

# Bootstrap Card Structure and Alert Standardization

## Context

This change affects several components in the application that currently have inconsistent card structure and alert message styling. After the successful Bootstrap migration, there are structural improvements needed to create consistency across card-like components and standardize alert message placement and styling.

**Current Issues:**
- **TimeSetup Component**: Migrated to Bootstrap Card but has unnecessary padding that conflicts with Card structure
- **ActivityManager**: Uses Bootstrap Container/Row/Col layout but should be structured as a Card to align headers with Timeline
- **Timeline Component**: Already properly structured as Bootstrap Card with header
- **Summary Component**: Uses Bootstrap Card but individual statistics could be better organized as nested cards
- **Alert Messages**: Inconsistent styling and placement across components for warnings and notifications

**User Needs:** 
- Visual consistency between card-structured components (TimeSetup, ActivityManager, Timeline)
- Unified header alignment between ActivityManager and Timeline
- Consistent alert message styling and placement for warnings like "planned time exceeded"
- Better visual hierarchy for statistics within Summary component

## Requirements

1. **TimeSetup Component Card Structure Fix**
   - Remove redundant padding that conflicts with Bootstrap Card padding
   - Ensure proper Card.Header and Card.Body structure
   - Verify consistent spacing with other card components
   - Testing: Visual regression tests to ensure no layout breaks

2. **ActivityManager Card Structure Migration** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Convert from Container-based layout to Bootstrap Card structure
   - âœ… Add Card.Header with "Activities" title to align with Timeline header
   - âœ… Move ActivityForm and activity list into Card.Body
   - âœ… Maintain existing Bootstrap Row/Col grid system within Card.Body
   - âœ… Update all related tests to reflect new Card-based structure
   - âœ… Testing: Verify all existing functionality preserved

3. **Timeline Header Alignment** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Ensure Timeline Card.Header aligns properly with ActivityManager Card.Header
   - âœ… Verify consistent header styling and spacing (both use h5 with mb-0)
   - âœ… Remove Container wrapper from Timeline to create pure Card structure
   - âœ… Testing: Visual alignment verification between components

4. **Summary Component Card Enhancement**
   - Enhance individual statistic display using nested Card components
   - Create consistent card structure for "Planned Time", "Spent Time", "Idle Time", "Overtime" statistics
   - Improve visual hierarchy and readability
   - Testing: Verify all statistics display correctly

5. **Alert Message Standardization** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Standardize all warning and notice alerts to use consistent Bootstrap Alert variants
   - âœ… Planned time exceeded warnings: Use `alert-warning` variant (implemented in Timeline)
   - âœ… Summary completion notices: Use `alert-success` or `alert-info` variants (already implemented)
   - âœ… Consistent placement within card structures (after headers, before main content)
   - âœ… Replace old Timeline alert with new standardized Bootstrap Alert
   - âœ… Testing: Verify alert accessibility and proper variant usage

6. **Alert Placement and Styling Standards**
   - Define consistent placement rules for alerts within card structures
   - Create shared utility classes for common alert patterns
   - Ensure alerts don't break card visual flow
   - Maintain proper spacing relationships with surrounding content
   - Testing: Verify alert placement in all affected components

## Technical Guidelines

- **Bootstrap Card Structure**: Use proper Card, Card.Header, Card.Body hierarchy
- **Spacing System**: Use Bootstrap spacing utilities (`mb-3`, `p-3`, etc.) instead of custom padding
- **Alert Variants**: Follow Bootstrap Alert variant guidelines:
  - `alert-success`: Positive completion states
  - `alert-warning`: Time exceeded or caution states  
  - `alert-info`: General information notices
  - `alert-danger`: Critical issues or errors
- **Grid Integration**: Maintain Bootstrap Row/Col system within Card.Body where needed
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure card structures work across all breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Maintain proper semantic structure and ARIA attributes
- **Theme Compatibility**: Use Bootstrap's default theme system for consistent appearance
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on visual regression and layout consistency testing

## Expected Outcome

**User Perspective:**
- Consistent visual structure across all card-based components
- Aligned headers between ActivityManager and Timeline create visual harmony
- Clear, consistently styled alerts that don't disrupt the interface flow
- Improved readability of statistics in Summary component
- Professional, cohesive appearance throughout the application

**Technical Perspective:**
- Consistent Bootstrap Card structure implementation across components
- Reduced custom CSS by leveraging Bootstrap's default spacing and structure
- Standardized alert messaging patterns that can be reused
- Improved maintainability through consistent component structure
- Better responsive behavior through proper Bootstrap implementation
- Enhanced accessibility through semantic HTML structure

**Testing Criteria:**
- All existing functionality preserved across affected components
- Visual alignment verified between card-structured components
- Alert messages display with consistent styling and proper variants
