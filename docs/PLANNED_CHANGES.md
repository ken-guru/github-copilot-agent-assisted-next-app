# Complete Application Rewrite: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

## Context
**Complete ground-up rewrite** of the existing Next.js application using React with Vite and Tailwind CSS. This is NOT a migration or port - it's a **complete recreation** of functionality using the current application only as a reference for:
- What features to implement
- How features should behave from a user perspective
- Visual design and layout patterns
- Component functionality and interactions

**Key Principle**: Write everything from scratch - components, tests, styling, utilities, and configuration. Use modern best practices and patterns throughout.

**Current Application Reference Points**:
- Custom theme system with light/dark/system mode switching
- Activity management components: ActivityForm, ActivityManager, Timeline
- Progress tracking: ProgressBar, Summary components
- Time management: TimeSetup, Timer functionality
- Visual feedback and responsive design
- TypeScript implementation with comprehensive test coverage

## Requirements

### 1. Project Foundation (Complete Greenfield Setup)
   - Create brand new Vite + React + TypeScript project
   - Design optimal file structure for React/Vite ecosystem
   - Configure Tailwind CSS with custom design system from scratch
   - Set up Vitest as test runner with React Testing Library
   - Configure modern ESLint/Prettier setup for React 18

   - **Integration testing for component interactions**
   - **Accessibility testing**
   - **Performance testing where relevant**

## Technical Guidelines

### Development Workflow
**IMPORTANT: Incremental Development with Git Tracking**

**Core Principle**: Implement each component incrementally with regular git commits to track progress and enable easy rollback if needed.

#### Per-Component Development Cycle:
1. **Analyze current feature** - understand user experience and behavior
2. **Design component API** - props, state, interactions  
3. **Write comprehensive tests** - define expected behavior
   - ðŸ”„ **COMMIT**: "Add tests for [ComponentName] - [brief description]"
4. **Implement component** - satisfy tests with modern patterns
   - ðŸ”„ **COMMIT**: "Implement [ComponentName] basic functionality"
5. **Style with Tailwind** - responsive, theme-aware design
   - ðŸ”„ **COMMIT**: "Add styling to [ComponentName] - responsive + theme support"
6. **Document component** - usage examples and API
   - ðŸ”„ **COMMIT**: "Document [ComponentName] - API and usage examples"
7. **Integrate and test** - verify with other components
   - ðŸ”„ **COMMIT**: "Integrate [ComponentName] with [related components]"

#### Git Commit Strategy:
- **Frequency**: Commit after each major step (tests, implementation, styling, integration)
- **Granularity**: One logical change per commit (easier to track and revert)
- **Messages**: Clear, descriptive commit messages following pattern:
  ```
  [Action] [Component/Feature] - [Brief description]
  
  Examples:
  - "Add tests for ActivityForm - form validation and state management"
  - "Implement ActivityManager - basic state machine logic" 
  - "Fix ActivityForm validation - handle edge cases"
  - "Integrate ActivityManager with Timeline - real-time updates"
  ```
- **Verification**: Run tests before each commit to ensure stability
- **Documentation**: Update memory logs at component completion milestones

#### Break Points for Review:
- After completing each component's test suite
- After implementing core component functionality
- After styling and theme integration
- After full component integration
- Before moving to next phase

#### Benefits of Incremental Approach:
- **Change Tracking**: Easy to see what changed when
- **Rollback Safety**: Can revert specific changes without losing other work
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear milestones and achievements  
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify when issues were introduced
- **Collaboration**: Better history for team understanding
