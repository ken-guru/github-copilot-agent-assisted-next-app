# Planned Changes Prompt Template
This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation. Once implemented, move the change to IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template
```markdown
# Feature/Change Title

## Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Which components/utilities are involved?
- What current behavior needs to change?
- What user needs does this address?

## Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. First requirement
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Testing requirements
2. Second requirement
   - Sub-points
   - Edge cases to handle
3. Additional requirements as needed

## Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Theme compatibility requirements
- Testing approach

## Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective
- Technical perspective
- Testing criteria

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases written
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

Note: When implementing a change, copy this template and fill it out completely. The more detailed the prompt, the better the AI assistance will be in implementation.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Security Vulnerabilities Resolution Plan

## Context
Identify and resolve potential security vulnerabilities in the application.

## Requirements
1. **Review and update dependencies**
   - Use `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - Update vulnerable packages to their latest secure versions.
   - Test the application thoroughly after updates to ensure no breaking changes.

2. **Implement secure coding practices**
   - Review code for common security issues such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
   - Implement input validation and sanitization where necessary.
   - Use secure methods for handling sensitive data.

3. **Enhance authentication and authorization**
   - Ensure strong password policies and hashing algorithms.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical actions.
   - Review and update access control mechanisms to follow the principle of least privilege.

4. **Improve error handling and logging**
   - Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information.
   - Implement comprehensive logging for security-related events.
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

5. **Conduct regular security assessments**
   - Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing.
   - Address any vulnerabilities identified during assessments promptly.
   - Keep security documentation up to date.

## Technical guidelines
- Follow OWASP guidelines for secure coding practices.
- Ensure compatibility with existing application architecture and dependencies.
- Maintain performance and accessibility standards.
- Test all changes thoroughly before deployment.

## Expected outcome
- Enhanced security posture of the application.
- Reduced risk of security breaches and data leaks.
- Improved trust and confidence among users.

## Validation criteria
- [ ] Dependencies updated and tested
- [ ] Secure coding practices implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms enhanced
- [ ] Error handling and logging improved
- [ ] Regular security assessments scheduled and documented
