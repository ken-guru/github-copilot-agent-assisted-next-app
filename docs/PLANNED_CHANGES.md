# Refine Progress Element Styling

## Context
- **Components Involved**: ProgressBar component (src/components/ProgressBar.tsx, src/components/ProgressBar.module.css)
- **Current Behavior**: The ProgressBar currently uses glow effects on the progress fill element with distinct color transitions at specific thresholds (green → yellow → orange → red). These effects don't align well with the cleaner aesthetic of the rest of the application.
- **User Needs**: A more cohesive visual experience with smoother color transitions that still communicate time progress clearly.

## Requirements
1. Remove glow effect styling from progress bar
   - Replace current box-shadow based glow effects with flat colors
   - Maintain the same basic color scheme (green/yellow/orange/red) but with cleaner styling
   - Ensure high contrast between progress fill and background for accessibility
   - Maintain existing functionality and component structure

2. Implement gradual color transitions
   - Create a system for smooth color interpolation between key threshold points:
     - 0% to 50%: Gradual transition from green to yellow
     - 50% to 75%: Gradual transition from yellow to orange
     - 75% to 100%: Gradual transition from orange to red
   - Ensure transitions are calculated based on exact percentage rather than class-based thresholds
   - Maintain existing ARIA attributes and accessibility features

3. Maintain theme compatibility
   - Ensure colors work appropriately in both light and dark themes
   - Use CSS variables where appropriate to maintain theme consistency
   - Test color contrast ratios in both theme modes

## Technical Guidelines
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theme-aware color values
- Implement color calculations using HSL color model for smoother transitions
- Use CSS transitions for any animation effects rather than keyframes where possible
- Avoid adding new dependencies just for color manipulation
- Ensure all changes maintain or improve the current accessibility standards
- Update existing tests to verify color transitions at various percentage points
- Verify calculations work correctly at edge cases (0%, 50%, 75%, 100%, >100%)
- Consider reduced motion preferences for any animations

## Expected Outcome

User perspective:
- Cleaner, more modern progress bar appearance
- Smoother visual feedback as time progresses
- Consistent visual language with the rest of the application
- Clear indication of time status through color

Technical perspective:
- Simplified CSS with fewer special effects (no box-shadows, glows)
- More maintainable color transition system
- Better theme integration
- No regression in functionality or accessibility

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases updated to verify color transitions
- [ ] Implementation complete with glow effects removed
- [ ] Smooth color transition implemented and working
- [ ] Verified compatibility with both light and dark themes
- [ ] Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary
