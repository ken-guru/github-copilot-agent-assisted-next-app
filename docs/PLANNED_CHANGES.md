# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Future Documentation Improvements

## Context
While we've completed the planned documentation improvements for the current phase, we've identified several additional enhancements that could further improve the documentation ecosystem in future phases.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Interactive Component Diagrams
- Create interactive component diagrams that show how data flows between components
- Enable filtering to show specific interactions or state flows
- Implement as SVG or JavaScript-based diagrams for better accessibility
- Link directly from diagrams to component documentation

### 2. Search Functionality Enhancement
- Add keyword metadata sections to each component documentation file
- Implement custom search functionality across documentation
- Create a search index for faster lookups
- Add type-ahead suggestions for component names and common terms

### 3. Code Snippet Improvements
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for code examples
- Implement syntax highlighting for better readability
- Create expandable/collapsible code sections for lengthy examples
- Add "Try it" links to CodeSandbox or similar platforms

### 4. Documentation Versioning
- Establish a versioning system for documentation
- Link documentation versions to code releases
- Maintain historical documentation for previous major versions
- Clearly indicate documentation currency and relevance

### 5. API Reference Enhancement
- Generate automated API documentation from TypeScript types
- Create interactive type exploration
- Implement cross-linking between related types and interfaces
- Add usage frequency indicators for various props and methods

### 6. Memory Log Integration Improvements
- Create bi-directional linking between components and memory logs
- Implement a visual timeline of component changes
- Add filtering by component or issue type
- Create visualization of related issues across components

### 7. Documentation Testing
- Implement automated checks for broken links
- Verify that all code examples compile and function correctly
- Test documentation rendering across device types
- Add checks for accessibility of documentation content

## Implementation Considerations
These improvements should be prioritized based on developer needs and available resources. Some improvements (like search functionality) may require additional tooling or infrastructure changes.

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced onboarding time for new developers
- Improved understanding of component relationships
- Faster issue resolution through better documentation discovery
- More consistent usage patterns across the application
- Better knowledge preservation and transfer

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Priorities established for suggested improvements
- [ ] Implementation plan created for highest priority items
- [ ] Resource requirements identified
- [ ] Timeline established for phased implementation

# Feature Implementation Plans

## Splash Screen Implementation

### Context
Adding a splash screen to improve the initial loading experience for users. The splash screen will display while the application is initializing, providing visual feedback and branding presence during the loading process.

### Requirements
1. Create a splash screen component
   - Display the application logo/branding
   - Add a loading indicator
   - Implement smooth transition animations
   - Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
2. Configure splash screen display logic
   - Show on initial application load
   - Hide automatically when application is ready
   - Provide option for minimum display time to prevent flickering
3. Optimize for performance
   - Ensure minimal impact on application load time
   - Use optimized image formats
   - Implement efficient animations

### Technical Guidelines
- Use CSS animations for smooth transitions
- Place splash screen at the root level for earliest possible rendering
- Implement with accessibility considerations (screen reader announcements)
- Ensure theme compatibility (light/dark mode)
- Use React lazy loading for the main app to ensure splash screen appears immediately

### Image Asset Requirements
- **File name:** splash-logo.webp (or splash-logo.png as fallback)
- **Placement:** `/public/images/splash/`
- **Formats needed:**
  - Primary: WebP format for modern browsers (smaller file size)
  - Fallback: PNG format for broader compatibility
  - Optional: SVG if the logo is vector-based
- **Sizing:**
  - Main logo: 200-300px width (responsive)
  - Favicon versions: 16x16, 32x32, 192x192, 512x512
- **Optimization:**
  - Compress images appropriately
  - Consider responsive image techniques

### Implementation Steps
1. Create splash screen component ✅
   - Create test file for the component ✅
   - Implement basic component structure ✅
   - Add styling and animations ✅
   - Verify responsive behavior ✅
2. Configure splash screen display logic ✅
   - Implement context/state for tracking app loading status ✅
   - Create hooks for managing splash screen visibility ✅
   - Add transition animations ✅
3. Integrate with application initialization ✅
   - Modify app entry point to include splash screen ✅
   - Add initialization status tracking ✅
   - Configure automatic transition timing ✅
4. Testing ✅
   - Unit tests for component behavior ✅
   - Unit tests for loading context ✅
   - Test accessibility implementation ✅
   - Test timing behavior ✅
5. Documentation
   - Component documentation ✅
   - Update implementation plan with status ✅
   - Add memory log entries for debugging process ✅

### Expected Outcome
- User perspective:
  - Immediate visual feedback when opening the application
  - Professional, branded loading experience
  - Smooth transition to main application
- Technical perspective:
  - Minimal impact on time-to-interactive metrics
  - Properly optimized image assets
  - Accessible implementation with proper ARIA attributes

### Validation Criteria
- [x] Test cases written for splash screen component

- [x] Tests passing for all splash screen functionality
- [x] Theme compatibility verified (light/dark mode)
- [x] Performance benchmarks within acceptable range
- [x] Documentation updated with splash screen component details
- [x] Accessibility testing completed

### Next Steps
1. Perform manual testing in different browsers and devices
2. Gather user feedback on the splash screen experience
3. Consider A/B testing different splash screen designs or animations
4. Monitor performance impact in production environment
5. Evaluate analytics data for potential improvements
