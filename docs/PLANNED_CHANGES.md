# Planned Changes Prompt Template
This file contains specifications for upcoming changes to the application. Each change should be documented in a format suitable for AI-assisted implementation. Once implemented, move the change to IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md with a timestamp.

## Change Request Template
```markdown
# Feature/Change Title

## Context
Provide context about the part of the application this change affects.
- Which components/utilities are involved?
- What current behavior needs to change?
- What user needs does this address?

## Requirements
Detailed specifications for the change:
1. First requirement
   - Implementation details
   - Technical considerations
   - Testing requirements
2. Second requirement
   - Sub-points
   - Edge cases to handle
3. Additional requirements as needed

## Technical Guidelines
- Framework-specific considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Theme compatibility requirements
- Testing approach

## Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like:
- User perspective
- Technical perspective
- Testing criteria

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Test cases written
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

Note: When implementing a change, copy this template and fill it out completely. The more detailed the prompt, the better the AI assistance will be in implementation.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Sequential Implementation
- Work on one change at a time - never move to the next item until the current one is complete
- Complete all validation criteria for the current task before starting a new one
- Avoid parallel development to prevent code conflicts and maintain focus
- For multi-phase changes (like the Time Utilities Consolidation below), complete each phase fully before starting the next
- Mark completed items in the validation criteria as they are finished

## Testing Requirements
- Each implementation must include appropriate tests before considering it complete
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation (Test-Driven Development)
- All tests must pass before a change is considered complete

## Documentation
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document all key decisions made during implementation
- Update the Memory Log for all significant changes or bug fixes

# Planned Changes - Code Refactoring for Large Files

## Overview

To reduce AI model token consumption and improve code maintainability, we need to refactor files exceeding 200 lines. This document outlines the files that need refactoring and proposes strategies based on file types.

- [ ] Create remaining files:
  ```
  /public/sw-core.js
  /public/sw-fetch-handlers.js
  /public/sw-lifecycle.js

- [ ] Set up module pattern for service worker files
- [ ] Create main entry point that imports all modules

#### 4. Implementation Phase - ETA: 2 days [IN PROGRESS - 20% COMPLETE]
- [x] Extract cache strategies to `sw-cache-strategies.js`
- [ ] Extract fetch handlers to `sw-fetch-handlers.js`

#### 5. Testing and Documentation - ETA: 1 day
- [ ] Verify all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Document the new service worker structure
- [ ] Update Memory Log with implementation details

## Next Target after Service Worker Refactoring

The next priority will be:

1. `ActivityManager.tsx` refactoring - ETA: 10 days
   - Will focus on extracting state management from UI rendering
   - Will improve component organization by separating concerns
   - Pre-analysis phase will begin once service worker refactoring is 75% complete
   - Target start: Within 1 week of completing the service worker refactoring

2. CSS Refactoring - ETA: To be determined
   - Lower priority task to be scheduled after component refactoring
   - Will focus on improving modularity and reducing CSS duplication
   - Will coordinate with the UI team on the best approach
