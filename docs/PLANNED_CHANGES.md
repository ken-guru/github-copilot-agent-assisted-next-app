## Current Planned Changes

# Bootstrap Component Migration

## Context
This change affects the entire UI component library of the application. Currently, the application uses custom/local UI components with CSS modules for styling throughout the codebase. The components that need to be replaced include:

**Current Custom Components:**
- `ActivityButton` - Activity selection and status display buttons
- `ActivityForm` - Form for adding new activities
- `ActivityManager` - Container and management for activities
- `ConfirmationDialog` - Modal dialog for confirmations
- `ProgressBar` - Progress visualization component
- `Summary` - Statistics and summary display cards
- `ThemeToggle` - Theme selection toggle buttons
- `TimeDisplay` - Time and date display components
- `TimeSetup` - Time configuration form
- `Timeline` - Timeline visualization component
- `OfflineIndicator` - Offline status notification
- `ServiceWorkerUpdater` - Update notification component
- `UpdateNotification` - General notification component

**Current Behavior:** Each component uses custom CSS modules with custom styling, spacing systems, and design patterns.

**User Needs:** This migration aims to standardize the UI, improve maintainability, reduce custom CSS, and leverage Bootstrap's well-tested component library for better consistency and accessibility.

## Requirements

1. **Bootstrap Setup and Configuration** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Install Bootstrap 5.x and react-bootstrap packages (react-bootstrap@2.10.10 and bootstrap@5.3.7)
   - âœ… Configure Bootstrap CSS integration with Next.js
   - âœ… Use Bootstrap's default styling and theming system
   - âœ… Defer custom theme integration for future consideration
   - âœ… Testing: Verify Bootstrap loads correctly with default styles

2. **Component Inventory and Mapping** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Create comprehensive checklist of all custom UI components
   - âœ… Map each custom component to appropriate Bootstrap equivalent:
     - `ActivityButton` â†’ Bootstrap `Button` with custom variants
     - `ConfirmationDialog` â†’ Bootstrap `Modal`
     - `ProgressBar` â†’ Bootstrap `ProgressBar`
     - `ThemeToggle` â†’ Bootstrap `ButtonGroup` or `ToggleButton`
     - `ActivityForm`/`TimeSetup` â†’ Bootstrap `Form`, `FormControl`, `InputGroup`
     - Cards and containers â†’ Bootstrap `Card`, `Container`, `Row`, `Col`
   - âœ… Identify components that need custom wrapper components
   - âœ… Document any Bootstrap gaps that require alternative solutions
   - âœ… Testing: Validate mapping decisions with UI mockups

3. **Test-First Migration Strategy**
   - Write/update tests for each component before refactoring
   - Ensure tests cover current behaviors, edge cases, and accessibility
   - Update test expectations to accommodate Bootstrap-specific props and behaviors
   - Test for visual regression and UI consistency during migration
   - Testing: All component tests must pass before and after migration

4. **Iterative Component Replacement**
   - Replace components one at a time or in small logical groups
   - For each component:
     - Refactor to use Bootstrap component instead of custom implementation
     - Remove custom CSS modules where Bootstrap handles styling
     - Update component interfaces to use Bootstrap props
     - Preserve existing functionality and accessibility features
     - Update associated tests to work with new Bootstrap implementation
   - Limit each commit to maximum 5 files unless tightly coupled
   - Testing: Manual verification after each component replacement

5. **Theme Integration and Customization**
   - Use Bootstrap's default theme and color system initially
   - Phase out custom CSS properties in favor of Bootstrap's design tokens
   - Consider future Bootstrap theme customization to match brand colors
   - Maintain light/dark mode support using Bootstrap's dark mode features (data-bs-theme)
   - Handle transition from custom CSS variables to Bootstrap's approach
   - Testing: Verify default Bootstrap styling works correctly

6. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Update component documentation to reflect Bootstrap usage patterns
   - Remove unused custom CSS modules and related files
   - Update import statements and component usage throughout codebase
   - Document any Bootstrap-specific patterns or customizations needed
   - Log challenges, workarounds, and decisions in Memory Log
   - Testing: Documentation examples must work correctly

## Technical Guidelines

- **Official Documentation**: Always refer to official documentation for best practices:
  - React Bootstrap: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction
  - Bootstrap 5.3: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
- **Package Versions**: Using bootstrap@5.3.7 and react-bootstrap@2.10.10
- **Next.js Integration**: Use proper Bootstrap integration for Next.js 15.x with official documentation guidance
- **React Bootstrap**: Prefer react-bootstrap over direct Bootstrap CSS classes for better React integration
- **Documentation References**: Follow https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction and https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
- **Package Versions**: Use react-bootstrap@2.10.10 and bootstrap@5.3.7 specifically
- **Default Styling**: Use Bootstrap's default theme and design tokens instead of custom CSS properties
- **Accessibility**: Ensure Bootstrap components meet existing accessibility standards
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size impact and lazy load Bootstrap components where appropriate
- **TypeScript**: Maintain full TypeScript support with proper Bootstrap component types
- **Testing Strategy**: Use testing-library patterns that work well with Bootstrap components
- **Migration Approach**: Use feature flags or component aliases to enable gradual migration
- **CSS Modules**: Phase out custom CSS modules gradually, replacing with Bootstrap's utility classes and components

## Expected Outcome

**User Perspective:**
- Visual consistency maintained or improved
- All existing functionality preserved
- Improved accessibility through Bootstrap's built-in features
- Consistent interaction patterns across components
- Theme switching continues to work seamlessly

**Technical Perspective:**
- Reduced custom CSS codebase by ~70-80%
- Standardized component library using Bootstrap's default design system
- Improved maintainability through well-documented Bootstrap patterns
- Enhanced accessibility through Bootstrap's ARIA implementations
- Faster development of new UI components using Bootstrap primitives
- Better responsive design through Bootstrap's grid system
- Reduced bundle size through elimination of redundant custom styles
- Consistent design language using Bootstrap's default theme

**Testing Criteria:**
- All existing tests pass with Bootstrap components
- Visual regression tests show Bootstrap's default styling is applied correctly
- Accessibility audit passes with same or better scores
- Performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
- Bootstrap's default theme renders consistently across components
