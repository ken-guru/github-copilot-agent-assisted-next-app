**Related Analysis:** [Beta Features Status](../analysis/beta-features-status.md)

## Overview
This document provides a decision matrix for beta features found in `/src/features/beta-features/`, determining which should be promoted to production, maintained as beta, or removed. The decisions are based on the analysis documented in [Beta Features Status](../analysis/beta-features-status.md).

## Decision Criteria

### Usage

- **Medium:** Used in testing or development
- **Low:** Unused

### Completeness
- **High:** Feature is fully implemented
- **Medium:** Feature is partially implemented
- **Low:** Feature is mostly incomplete

### Value
- **High:** Provides significant business or user value
- **Medium:** Provides moderate value
- **Low:** Provides minimal value

### Maintenance Cost
- **High:** Requires significant effort to maintain
- **Medium:** Requires moderate effort to maintain
- **Low:** Requires minimal effort to maintain

## Feature Decisions

*For each feature, the following matrix will be populated:*
