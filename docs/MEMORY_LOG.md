# Memory Log

## Purpose
This document tracks solutions attempted by AI for application issues. It prevents repetitive solution attempts by maintaining a history of approaches that have been tried.

## How to Use
1. Before attempting to solve an issue, check this log for similar problems
2. If a similar issue exists, review previous approaches before trying new solutions
3. If no similar issue exists, create a new entry using the template below
4. Add details of each solution attempt to the appropriate issue entry

## Entry Format
Each issue receives a unique ID (format: MRTMLY-XXX) and includes attempted approaches, outcomes, and relevant tags.

## Memory Template
