- Maintaining desktop compatibility while optimizing mobile

## Dark Theme Implementation (2024-01-24)

### Context
The application needed a comprehensive dark theme to reduce eye strain and provide better accessibility. This implementation showcases how to:
- Transform an existing light-themed application to support multiple themes
- Implement HSL-based color system with CSS variables
- Handle theme preferences with system detection

### Implementation Details
1. Color System Implementation
   - Base HSL palette:
     ```css
     Background: hsl(220, 13%, 18%)
     Text: hsl(220, 13%, 95%)
     Accent: [hue-specific values]
     ```
   - Consistent hue values across themes
   - Variable saturation/lightness for variants
   - Status color adjustments for dark mode

2. CSS Architecture
   - Global CSS variables in :root
   - Theme-specific overrides
   - Transition handling
   - Component-specific adaptations

3. Theme Toggle Implementation
   - System preference detection
   - Manual override support
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - Smooth theme transitions

4. Component Updates
   - Color variable conversion
   - Dark theme testing
   - Accessibility verification
   - Shadow adjustments

5. Technical Implementation
   - CSS variable naming conventions
   - Theme transition system
   - SVG/asset handling
   - Test suite updates

### Testing Approach
- Theme toggle functionality
- System preference handling
- LocalStorage persistence
- Component appearance in both themes
- Transition animations
- Accessibility compliance

### Validation Results
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Theme switching working
- ✅ System preference detection functional
- ✅ Color contrast meeting WCAG guidelines
- ✅ Smooth transitions implemented

### Reference Implementation
This change can serve as a template for:
- Adding theme support to other applications
- Implementing HSL-based color systems
- Creating theme toggle functionality
- Handling system theme preferences

## Activity State Machine Implementation (2024-01-26)

### Context
Previously, activity state management was spread across multiple hooks and utilities, making state transitions complex and potentially inconsistent. This implementation centralizes state management in a dedicated state machine.

### Implementation Details
1. Core Components:
   - ActivityStateMachine class in activityUtils.ts
   - Defined states: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, REMOVED
   - Valid transitions:
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> REMOVED
     * PENDING -> REMOVED

2. Key Features:
   - Single source of truth for activity states
   - Explicit state transitions with validation
   - Temporal tracking (startedAt, completedAt, removedAt)
   - Current activity tracking
   - Clear completion logic

3. Integration Points:
   - useActivitiesTracking hook uses state machine internally
   - useActivityState hook leverages state machine for activity management
   - activityUtils.ts updated to use state machine for completion logic

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Activity States
type ActivityStateType = 'PENDING' | 'RUNNING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'REMOVED';

// Activity State Interface
interface ActivityState {
  id: string;
  state: ActivityStateType;
  startedAt?: number;    // Set when activity starts
  completedAt?: number;  // Set when activity completes
  removedAt?: number;    // Set when activity is removed
}

// State Machine Capabilities
- Add activities (always in PENDING state)
- Start activities (PENDING -> RUNNING)
- Complete activities (RUNNING -> COMPLETED)
- Remove activities (PENDING/RUNNING -> REMOVED)
- Query current activity and states
- Validate state transitions
- Track activity history
```

### Testing Approach
1. State Transition Testing:
   - Valid state transitions
   - Invalid state transition prevention
   - Temporal data tracking
   - Current activity management

2. Integration Testing:
   - Hook integration
   - Component interaction
   - Timeline integrity
   - Backward compatibility

3. Edge Cases:
   - Multiple activities
   - Activity removal mid-session
   - Activity completion order
   - Timeline consistency

### Migration Strategy
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Preserved existing activity data
- Updated tests to reflect new state model
- Documented new implementation

### Benefits Achieved
1. Technical Improvements:
   - Single source of truth for activity state
   - Explicit and validated state transitions
   - Simplified completion logic
   - Improved testability
   - Better maintainability

2. User Experience:
   - More predictable activity progression
   - Clearer activity state feedback
   - Consistent behavior across scenarios
   - Reliable completion handling
