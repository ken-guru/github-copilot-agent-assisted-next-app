## Fix Premature Summary State Transition Bug (2024-08-14)

### Context
The application had a critical bug where users could reach the summary state prematurely:

     ```css
     Background: hsl(220, 13%, 18%)
     Text: hsl(220, 13%, 95%)
     Accent: [hue-specific values]
     ```
   - Consistent hue values across themes
   - Variable saturation/lightness for variants
   - Status color adjustments for dark mode

- Creating theme toggle functionality
- Handling system theme preferences

## Activity State Machine Implementation (2024-01-26)

### Context
Previously, activity state management was spread across multiple hooks and utilities, making state transitions complex and potentially inconsistent. This implementation centralizes state management in a dedicated state machine.

### Implementation Details
1. Core Components:
   - ActivityStateMachine class in activityUtils.ts
   - Defined states: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, REMOVED
   - Valid transitions:
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> REMOVED
     * PENDING -> REMOVED

2. Key Features:
   - Single source of truth for activity states
   - Explicit state transitions with validation
   - Temporal tracking (startedAt, completedAt, removedAt)
   - Current activity tracking
   - Clear completion logic

3. Integration Points:
   - useActivitiesTracking hook uses state machine internally
   - useActivityState hook leverages state machine for activity management
   - activityUtils.ts updated to use state machine for completion logic

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Activity States
type ActivityStateType = 'PENDING' | 'RUNNING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'REMOVED';

// Activity State Interface
interface ActivityState {
  id: string;
  state: ActivityStateType;
  startedAt?: number;    // Set when activity starts
  completedAt?: number;  // Set when activity completes
  removedAt?: number;    // Set when activity is removed
}

// State Machine Capabilities
- Add activities (always in PENDING state)
- Start activities (PENDING -> RUNNING)
- Complete activities (RUNNING -> COMPLETED)
- Remove activities (PENDING/RUNNING -> REMOVED)
- Query current activity and states
- Validate state transitions
- Track activity history
```

### Testing Approach
1. State Transition Testing:
   - Valid state transitions
   - Invalid state transition prevention
   - Temporal data tracking
   - Current activity management

2. Integration Testing:
   - Hook integration
   - Component interaction
   - Timeline integrity
   - Backward compatibility

3. Edge Cases:
   - Multiple activities
   - Activity removal mid-session
   - Activity completion order
   - Timeline consistency

### Migration Strategy
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Preserved existing activity data
- Updated tests to reflect new state model
- Documented new implementation

### Benefits Achieved
1. Technical Improvements:
   - Single source of truth for activity state
   - Explicit and validated state transitions
   - Simplified completion logic
   - Improved testability
   - Better maintainability

2. User Experience:
   - More predictable activity progression
   - Clearer activity state feedback
   - Consistent behavior across scenarios
   - Reliable completion handling

## Activity Auto-Start Prevention (2024-01-20)

### Context
Previously, activities would automatically start when added to the list, leading to unintended state transitions and potential timing inaccuracies.

### Implementation Details
1. Modified ActivityManager component to use `justAdd` parameter when adding new activities
2. Ensured default activities are added in pending state during initialization
3. Updated tests to verify correct activity state handling

### Technical Details
- Activities now start in PENDING state when added
- Added unit test to verify new activities don't auto-start
- Maintained compatibility with existing activity state machine
- Preserved existing state transition rules

### Benefits Achieved
1. User Experience:
   - Activities remain in pending state until explicitly started
   - More predictable activity transitions
   - Better control over activity timing
   - Accurate activity duration tracking

2. Technical Improvements:
   - Clearer activity state management
   - More reliable state transitions
   - Better test coverage for activity states
   - Eliminated unintended state changes

### Verification
- All unit tests passing (168 tests)
- End-to-end tests passing (6 scenarios)
- Manual testing confirms expected behavior
