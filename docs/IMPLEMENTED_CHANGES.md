## Activity State Machine Implementation (2024-01-26)

### Context
Previously, activity state management was spread across multiple hooks and utilities, making state transitions complex and potentially inconsistent. This implementation centralizes state management in a dedicated state machine.

### Implementation Details
1. Core Components:
   - ActivityStateMachine class in activityUtils.ts
   - Defined states: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, REMOVED
   - Valid transitions:
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED
     * PENDING -> RUNNING -> REMOVED
     * PENDING -> REMOVED

2. Key Features:
   - Single source of truth for activity states
   - Explicit state transitions with validation
   - Temporal tracking (startedAt, completedAt, removedAt)
   - Current activity tracking
   - Clear completion logic

3. Integration Points:
   - useActivitiesTracking hook uses state machine internally
   - useActivityState hook leverages state machine for activity management
   - activityUtils.ts updated to use state machine for completion logic

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Activity States
type ActivityStateType = 'PENDING' | 'RUNNING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'REMOVED';

// Activity State Interface
interface ActivityState {
  id: string;
  state: ActivityStateType;
  startedAt?: number;    // Set when activity starts
  completedAt?: number;  // Set when activity completes
  removedAt?: number;    // Set when activity is removed
}

// State Machine Capabilities
- Add activities (always in PENDING state)
- Start activities (PENDING -> RUNNING)
- Complete activities (RUNNING -> COMPLETED)
- Remove activities (PENDING/RUNNING -> REMOVED)
- Query current activity and states
- Validate state transitions
- Track activity history
```

### Testing Approach
1. State Transition Testing:
   - Valid state transitions
   - Invalid state transition prevention
   - Temporal data tracking
   - Current activity management
