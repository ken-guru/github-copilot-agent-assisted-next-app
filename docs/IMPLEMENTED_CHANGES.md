### Session Sharing: Robust, Privacy-Preserving, Theme-Correct - COMPLETED (2025-08-21)

**Summary:**
Implemented end-to-end Session Sharing with strong privacy, SSR safety, and resilient storage. Users can create a share link, open a dedicated `/shared/[id]` view with theme-aware colors, download JSON, and restore the session via Replace/Import while preserving descriptions and color fidelity.

**PR/Branch:**
- PR: #342
- Branch: `fix-341-preview-read-bypass-finalization`

**Key Features and Guarantees:**
- SSR-safe absolute URLs: prefer server-provided `shareUrl`, fall back to `window.origin` only on client
- Privacy by default: anonymized payload (no `userAgent`), safe logs (no tokens), origin validation
- Data fidelity: activity `description` included and preserved across export/import/replace
- Theme correctness on shared page: color normalization (palette exact match + hue-nearest fallback)
- Deterministic blob naming, per-host rate limiting, and robust content-type detection
- JSON export contains used colors (no `colorIndex` leakage)
- A11y polish for Share Controls and toasts; Replace button contrast improvement; human-readable header timestamp

**Storage Strategy:**
- SDK-first Vercel Blob writes; REST fallback with safe headers
- Offline/test fallbacks to local store to avoid hitting Vercel in Jest
- No tokens in URLs; redacted logging

**Testing and Quality Gates:**
- Jest unit tests for storage fallbacks, schema validation, description preservation, and theme normalization
- CI-safe: tests/lint/type-check/build all passing locally and on CI
- Avoids network calls in Jest by design; content-type detection hardened

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/dev-guides/session-sharing.md` (developer guide: architecture, schema, storage, API, testing)
- `docs/SHARING.md` (user guide and troubleshooting)
- `README.md` (feature overview and links)
- `docs/components/ShareControls.md` and index link in `docs/components/README.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Session Sharing verification addendum)
- `docs/workflows/testing-procedures.md` (Jest-first strategy for sharing)

**Success Criteria Met:**
- Robust sharing under SSR and client
- Privacy and security guardrails
- Theme-aware shared view
- Descriptions and colors preserved end-to-end

### Timeline Sharing Scaling Fix, CRUD Smart Color Suggestion, and Dependency Modernization - COMPLETED (2025-08-25)

**Summary:**
Resolved two user-facing issues and modernized transitive dependencies to remove deprecated packages:
- Fixes timeline scaling and break rendering in the sharing view by basing calculations on provided `elapsedTime` and limiting ticking to active/ongoing states.
- Enables smart default color suggestion in Activity CRUD add form by delegating to `getSmartColorIndex` using existing activities.
- Enforces `glob@^10` across the dependency tree and removes deprecated `inflight@1.0.6`.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Issue #349: Sharing timeline not scaling/marking correctly
- Issue #345: CRUD form should suggest next available color

**PR/Branch:**
- PR: #351
- Branch: `fix-345-349-deps-upgrade`

**Key Changes:**
- `src/components/feature/Timeline.tsx`: Compute time-left from `elapsedTime` for shared/static views; start ticking only when `timerActive` or an ongoing entry exists; include overtime for effective duration and markers.
- `src/components/feature/ActivityCrud.tsx`: Pass `existingActivities={activities}` to `ActivityForm` to enable smart default color preselection.
- `package.json`: Add `overrides` to force `glob@^10`, upgrade `test-exclude` to `^7.0.1` (uses `glob@10`), and alias deprecated `inflight` to an empty placeholder.

**Testing and Quality Gates:**
- Updated CRUD test expectation for default color to match smart selection behavior (defaults occupy indices 0â€“3, next is Red at index 4).
- Jest: 132/132 suites passing; all tests green.
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run type-check`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS

**Notes:**
- No breaking public APIs.
- Shared view remains SSR-safe and theme-aware.

#### Adjustment: Canonical Timeline in Shared View Only (2025-08-25)

- Reverted main app Completed state to render `Summary` only (no Timeline)
- Updated `/shared/[id]` to reuse the canonical `src/components/Timeline.tsx`
- Ensured shared Timeline is frozen by passing `timerActive={false}`; internal logic only ticks if last entry is ongoing
- Added `"use client"` directive to `Timeline.tsx` to satisfy Next.js client-hook requirements
- Rebuilt and validated: tests, lint, type-check, and production build all passing

#### Addendum: Freeze "now" in Shared Timeline (2025-08-25)

- Eliminated drift caused by `Date.now()` in static/shared views by introducing an optional `nowMs` parameter to `timelineCalculations`
- `Timeline` now computes a snapshot `nowMs` as `firstEntry.startTime + (elapsedTime * 1000)` and passes it into calculations
- Shared `/shared/[id]` view sets `timerActive={false}` so no ticking occurs; the snapshot ensures the post-last-activity break remains constant across refreshes
- Retains backwards compatibility: when `nowMs` is not provided, runtime views still rely on `Date.now()`
