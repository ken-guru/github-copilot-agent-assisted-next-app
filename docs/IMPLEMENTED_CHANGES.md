### Adjustments to JSON import and export (#242) - COMPLETED (2025-07-21)

**Summary:**
Implemented robust import/export logic for activities. Import now auto-populates missing fields (e.g., only `name` present), and export omits `isActive` by default. All tests, documentation, and memory logs updated.

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/utils/activity-storage.ts` (import/export logic)
- `src/utils/activity-storage.test.ts` (tests)
- `docs/components/activity-storage.md` (documentation)
- `docs/logged_memories/MRTMLY-220-json-import-export-auto-populate.md` (memory log)
- `docs/MEMORY_LOG.md` (memory log reference)

**Key Achievements:**
- Import supports incomplete JSON objects, auto-filling missing fields
- Export omits `isActive` unless explicitly required
- All edge cases covered by Jest tests
- Documentation and memory log updated

**Validation:**
- All tests, lint, and type checks pass
- Change documented and memory log created
