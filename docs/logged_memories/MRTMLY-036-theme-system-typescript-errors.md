### Issue: MRTMLY-036: Theme System TypeScript Errors Post-Unification
**Date:** 2023-12-02
**Tags:** #typescript #theme-system #type-errors #interface-mismatch #unification
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- After successful completion of test fixes for the Theme System Unification, we encountered TypeScript errors during type checking
- Six TypeScript errors are detected across four files during the `npm run type-check` command
- The errors indicate interface mismatches between our ThemeContext implementation and component usage
- All tests are passing, but the TypeScript errors would block deployment

#### Debug Process
1. Initial analysis of TypeScript errors
   - Two components (`Summary.tsx` and `Timeline.tsx`) are trying to access a non-existent `isDark` property
     ```typescript
     const { isDark } = useTheme();
     // Error: Property 'isDark' does not exist on type 'ThemeContextType'
     ```
   - The `ThemeContext.test.tsx` file has three errors related to using properties from a potentially null context
     ```typescript
     const { theme, toggleTheme, setTheme } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
     // Error: Properties don't exist on type 'ThemeContextType | null'
     ```
   - The `context/index.ts` file is attempting to export a `Theme` type that doesn't exist in `ThemeContext.tsx`
     ```typescript
     export { ThemeContext, ThemeProvider, type Theme } from './ThemeContext';
     // Error: Module has no exported member 'Theme'
     ```

2. Root cause investigation
   - During the Theme System Unification, we aligned test implementations but missed updating types
   - The useTheme hook likely returns `isDarkMode` but components are using `isDark`
   - The `ThemeContext` appears to be typed as possibly null, but is being accessed without null checks
   - The `Theme` type export may have been moved or renamed during unification

3. Planned solution approach
   - Update the `Summary` and `Timeline` components to use the correct property name (likely `isDarkMode` instead of `isDark`)
   - Add proper null checking or type assertion for `ThemeContext` in the test file
   - Fix the type export in `context/index.ts` by identifying the correct type name
   - Verify all type changes match the actual implementation of the Theme system

#### Expected Resolution
- Update property names in component files to match the ThemeContext interface
- Add proper type handling for the ThemeContext in tests
- Fix the type export in the context index file
- Run type checking again to confirm all errors are resolved
- Verify that tests continue to pass after the type fixes
