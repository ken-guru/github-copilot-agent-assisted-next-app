### Issue: MRTMLY-007: Service Worker Network-Aware Retry Enhancement
**Date:** 2024-11-20
**Tags:** #service-worker #retry-mechanism #offline #network-awareness
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker update retry mechanism implemented (from MRTMLY-006)
- Retry attempts occurring even when device is offline
- Unnecessary network requests wasting resources 
- Need for smarter network-aware update behavior

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated network awareness options
   - Researched navigator.onLine API capabilities
   - Explored network information API compatibility
   - Determined event-based approach was needed

2. Solution attempts
   - Implemented basic navigator.onLine check
     - Added condition before retry attempts
     - Outcome: Basic improvement but still issues
     - Issue: No handling for network status changes

   - Added online/offline event listeners
     - Created event handlers for online and offline events
     - Implemented queue for delayed retries
     - Outcome: Better but had memory leaks
     - Why: Event listeners weren't being cleaned up

   - Implemented comprehensive solution
     - Created network status service with proper cleanup
     - Added retry queue with persistence
     - Implemented exponential backoff with network awareness
     - Outcome: Successful network-aware retry system

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Network status monitoring with proper event listener cleanup
  - Persistent retry queue that pauses when offline
  - Automatic retry resumption when network returns
  - Configurable retry parameters (attempts, delay)
- Tests added to verify behavior under different network conditions

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Network awareness is essential for mobile-first applications
  - Event listeners always need proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Persistent queues provide better user experience for offline scenarios
- Future considerations:
  - Explore more sophisticated network quality detection
  - Add user-facing indication of update status
  - Consider implementing background sync API when available
