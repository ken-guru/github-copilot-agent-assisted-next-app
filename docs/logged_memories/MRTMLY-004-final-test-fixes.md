### Issue: Final Test Fixes Session
**Date:** 2023-11-17
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #layout #theme #mocking

#### Initial State
- Two remaining test failures:
  1. Layout test failing with component structure verification
     - Expected: `ObjectContaining {"name": "LayoutClient"}`
     - Received: `[Function MockLayoutClient]`
  2. SplashScreen test failing due to missing theme utility module
     - Cannot find module '../../../utils/theme'

#### Debug Process
1. Theme utility investigation
   - The SplashScreen test requires a theme utility module at `../../../utils/theme`
   - Determined we need to create a comprehensive theme utility with core functionality:
     - Detecting current theme
     - Applying dark/light themes
     - Working with system preferences
     - Managing user preferences in localStorage
   - The utility needs to be SSR-safe with proper checks for browser environment

2. Layout test component mock investigation
   - Test expected LayoutClient component to have a 'name' property equal to 'LayoutClient'
   - The mock function's name property is not matching what the test expects
   - Function names in JavaScript are read-only in strict mode, requiring special handling

#### Resolution
1. Created comprehensive theme utility with:
   - `isDarkTheme()` - Detection function
   - `applyDarkTheme()` - Dark theme application
   - `applyLightTheme()` - Light theme application
   - `applySystemTheme()` - System preference handling
   - `getUserThemePreference()` - localStorage preference retrieval
   - `setUserThemePreference()` - localStorage preference setting
   - All functions with proper SSR checks (typeof document/window === 'undefined')

2. Fixed LayoutClient mock by:
   - Preserving the component's displayName
   - Using Object.defineProperty to explicitly set the 'name' property
   - This ensures the mock component matches the test's expectations

#### Lessons Learned
- Function name properties in JavaScript are normally read-only in strict mode
- Mock components need special handling when tests check function name properties
- Theme handling requires consistent utility functions that work across components
- SSR compatibility requires checking for browser environment before accessing document/window
- Jest mocking paths must match the actual file structure
