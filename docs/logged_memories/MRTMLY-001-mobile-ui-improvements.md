# Mobile UI Improvements

**Status:** In Progress

## Initial State
The current mobile UI has several issues:
1. UI elements are too small and not touch-friendly
2. No indication when the user enters overtime
3. The visual structure has variable nesting of elements which impacts clarity

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Restructure App Component Layout
- Create clear semantic sections (header, main, footer)
- Move all UI elements to appropriate sections
- Apply mobile-first styling approach

### 2. Mobile-Friendly UI Components
- Implement a responsive scaling system using CSS variables
- Create touch-friendly button styles with minimum 44px touch targets
- Add proper spacing between interactive elements

### 3. Overtime Indicator
- Create a new OvertimeIndicator component
- Implement visual feedback (color change, animation)
- Display overtime duration

### 4. Responsive Layout Strategy
- Use CSS Grid for top-level layout
- Implement feature detection for optimal mobile experience
- Create viewport-aware hook for responsive behavior

## Technical Details

### CSS Variable Approach
Instead of directly using viewport units (which can cause issues), we'll:
- Define base size variables at the :root level
- Use media queries to adjust these variables at different breakpoints
- Apply the variables to components rather than direct viewport units

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
├── Header
│   ├── Logo
│   └── ThemeSwitcher
├── Main
│   ├── DurationSetup
│   ├── Progress
│   ├── TimeCounter/OvertimeIndicator
│   ├── ActivityManager
│   ├── Timeline
│   └── Summary
└── Footer
    ├── ResetButton
    └── CompleteAllButton
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for new components (OvertimeIndicator)
- Responsive tests with various viewport sizes
- Accessibility testing for touch targets
- Visual regression testing for overtime states

## Lessons Learned
(To be completed after implementation)
