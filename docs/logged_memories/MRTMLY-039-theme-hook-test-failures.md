### Issue: MRTMLY-039: Theme Hook Test Failures Due to __esModule Property Conflict
**Date:** 2025-04-01
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #theme-system #esmodule #test-conflicts
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Multiple test suite failures related to useTheme hook
- TypeError: "Cannot redefine property: __esModule" appearing in tests
- Tests passing individually but failing when run together
- Conflict occurring when multiple tests try to mock the useTheme hook

#### Debug Process
1. Examined test failures pattern
   - Found test failures happening in multiple component tests
   - Identified TypeError specifically related to redefining __esModule property
   - Determined that the core issue was in how the hook was being exported

2. Investigated useTheme.ts file
   - Found `export const __esModule = true` at the end of the file
   - This special property was causing conflicts when imported in multiple test files
   - Each test module was trying to redefine this special property, leading to errors
   - Identified that this property was added for test mocking purposes but causing unintended side effects

3. Solution implementation
   - Removed the `export const __esModule = true` line from useTheme.ts
   - This property is automatically handled by the module system and doesn't need explicit definition
   - Confirmed that tests could still effectively mock the hook without this explicit export

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Removed the problematic `__esModule = true` export from useTheme.ts
  - Allowed the JavaScript module system to handle module type properly
  - Tests now run successfully both individually and as part of the full suite
- The test suite now runs without the TypeError, resolving a significant number of test failures

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Special properties like `__esModule` should generally not be explicitly exported
  - When multiple test files import and mock the same module, be careful about module-level properties
  - The ES module system automatically handles the `__esModule` property
- Future considerations:
  - Review other utility hooks for similar patterns that might cause test conflicts
  - Consider creating a more standardized approach to mocking hooks in tests
  - Document best practices for module exports that are frequently mocked in tests
