### Issue: MRTMLY-184: Vercel Deployment Verification Requirements
**Date:** 2024-02-05
**Tags:** #deployment #vercel #type-checking #quality-assurance
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Vercel deployments failing without clear error messages
- Local development works without issues
- Type checking passes locally but fails in deployment
- No consistent pre-deployment verification process

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated Vercel build logs
   - Found type errors that weren't appearing locally
   - Identified stricter TypeScript checking in Vercel environment
   - Determined CI process needed additional verification steps

2. Solution attempts
   - Added type-check script to package.json
     - Used `tsc --noEmit` to verify types without building
     - Outcome: Caught type errors but still deployment failures
     - Issue: Build process needed more comprehensive checks

   - Implemented pre-deployment verification script
     - Combined type checking, linting, and tests
     - Outcome: Better but still missing some errors
     - Why: Some TypeScript configuration differences between environments

   - Updated tsconfig.json for stricter checks
     - Enabled stricter options including noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks
     - Added pre-commit hooks to verify before pushing
     - Outcome: Successfully caught all deployment-breaking issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Comprehensive pre-deployment verification script
  - Updated TypeScript configuration to match Vercel environment
  - Added Husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks
  - Created documentation for the verification process
- All deployments now passing consistently

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Development environment should match deployment environment as closely as possible
  - Automated verification before pushing prevents failed deployments
  - Type checking should always use the strictest configuration
- Future considerations:
  - Consider integrating deployment verification into GitHub Actions
  - Create more detailed error reporting for failed verifications
  - Implement staged deployment workflow with automatic verification
