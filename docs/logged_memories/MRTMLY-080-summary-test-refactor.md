### Issue: MRTMLY-185: Summary Component Test Suite Refactor
**Date:** 2024-02-10
**Tags:** #testing #refactoring #edge-cases #performance
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Summary component test suite showing intermittent failures
- Tests running slowly and inconsistently
- Edge cases not properly covered
- Mock data inconsistencies causing false positives

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed existing test suite
   - Found excessive mock data duplication
   - Identified incomplete teardown between tests
   - Discovered time-dependent tests without proper controls

2. Solution attempts
   - Centralized mock data generation
     - Created factory functions for consistent test data
     - Outcome: Improved consistency but still performance issues
     - Issue: Tests still taking too long to run

   - Implemented proper test isolation
     - Added complete teardown between tests
     - Fixed time-dependent tests with Jest's fake timers
     - Outcome: More reliable but missing edge cases
     - Why: Several scenarios weren't being tested

   - Comprehensive test coverage expansion
     - Added tests for all edge cases (empty state, error state, etc.)
     - Implemented snapshot testing for complex UI states
     - Created performance optimized test helpers
     - Outcome: Successful comprehensive test suite

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Centralized test data with factory functions
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all component states
  - Proper test isolation with complete teardown
  - Controlled time-dependent behavior
  - Performance optimizations for faster test runs
- All tests now reliable and comprehensive

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Test data should be centralized and consistent
  - Time-dependent tests need explicit control
  - Edge cases must be specifically tested
- Future considerations:
  - Create standard test helpers for common patterns
  - Consider implementing visual regression testing
  - Establish performance benchmarks for test runs
