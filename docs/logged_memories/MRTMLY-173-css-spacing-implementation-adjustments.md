### Issue: MRTMLY-045: CSS Spacing Scale Implementation Adjustments
**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Tags:** #css #refactoring #spacing-system #variables #visual-design
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- The application's CSS spacing scale was simplified from an 8-point system (2xs to 3xl) to a 5-point system (xs to xl)
- Initial implementation updated CSS variables in globals.css
- Some components, including the Summary component's activity items, had insufficient padding after the migration
- The activityItem elements specifically had padding: var(--space-xs) which resulted in too little spacing

#### Implementation Process
1. Analysis of visual issues
   - Identified that activity items in the Summary component appeared too cramped
   - Determined that the previous spacing value (--space-xs at 0.25rem/4px) was too small after migration
   - Evaluated appropriate spacing for the component's visual hierarchy

2. Implementation approach
   - Updated padding in Summary.module.css to use var(--space-sm) for activityItem elements
   - This increased padding from 0.25rem (4px) to 0.5rem (8px)
   - The change maintains proper spacing relationships with other elements
   - Verified the change doesn't cause layout shifts or overflow issues

3. Verification process
   - Visually inspected the component to confirm improved spacing
   - Ran tests to ensure no regressions were introduced
   - Verified in both light and dark themes

#### Resolution
- Successfully increased padding for activity items in the Summary component
- All tests are passing after the change
- Component now has appropriate breathing room and spacing
- Visual hierarchy is maintained while improving readability

#### Lessons Learned
- When migrating from a more complex to simpler spacing system, visual verification is crucial
- Some components may need manual adjustments to maintain proper visual density
- CSS module-level changes after a global refactoring should be carefully tracked to maintain design consistency
- Test coverage is essential for ensuring spacing changes don't introduce layout regressions
