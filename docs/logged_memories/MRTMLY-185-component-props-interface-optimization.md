# MRTMLY-003: Component Props Interface Optimization

**Date:** 2025-05-19  
**Tags:** #typescript #components #interfaces #documentation  
**Status:** Completed

## Initial State

The current component props interfaces in the codebase have several issues:

1. **Inconsistent Interface Naming**:
   - Some components use explicit interfaces (e.g., `ActivityManagerProps`)
   - Others don't have explicitly named interfaces (just inline prop types)
   - Naming conventions vary across components

2. **Missing or Incomplete JSDoc Comments**:
   - Most prop interfaces lack proper documentation
   - Missing descriptions of what each prop does
   - Missing information about required vs optional props

3. **Some Props Have Unclear Types**:
   - Some props use basic types like `string` or `number` without more specific typing
   - Some props are marked optional but might be functionally required
   - Function props could benefit from more specific return types

4. **Inconsistent Default Value Handling**:
   - Some components define defaults in the destructuring assignment
   - Others handle defaults within the function body
   - Some are using ES6 default parameter values, others use ternary operators

## Implementation Plan

Following the test-first development principle, we will:

1. **Create Component Props Interface Tests**:
   - Tests that validate components render correctly with different prop combinations
   - Tests that validate required vs optional props
   - Tests to ensure backward compatibility

2. **Standardize Interface Naming Convention**:
   - Use `[ComponentName]Props` for all component prop interfaces
   - Export interfaces when they're used by other components
   - Keep internal interfaces private when used only within the file

3. **Add Comprehensive JSDoc Comments**:
   - Add descriptions for each interface
   - Document each prop with @param JSDoc tags
   - Indicate required vs optional status
   - Add @example where appropriate

4. **Improve Type Specificity**:
   - Use more specific types than `string`/`number` where appropriate
   - Use union types for props with specific allowed values
   - Define function signatures with proper parameter and return types

5. **Standardize Default Value Handling**:
   - Use ES6 default parameter values in component destructuring
   - Document default values in JSDoc
   - Ensure consistency across components

6. **Implementation Order**:
   - Start with feature components, then UI components
   - Start with one component to establish the pattern, then apply to others
   - Verify each component still works properly after changes
   - Make sure to update any component imports/references as needed

## Lessons Learned

1. **Better Interface Documentation Improves Developer Experience**
   - Adding comprehensive JSDoc comments makes component usage clearer
   - Documenting default values helps developers understand behavior without reading implementation
   - Standardized interface naming makes the codebase more consistent

2. **Type Specificity Enhances Safety**
   - Using more specific prop types helps catch potential issues at compile-time
   - Explicitly documenting function parameter and return types clarifies expectations
   - Making required vs optional props clear helps prevent runtime errors

3. **Component Interface Design Considerations**
   - Props that are purely for API compatibility should be marked as such
   - Using consistent naming patterns across similar components improves maintainability
   - Exposing interfaces even for components without props provides consistency and future-proofs the code

4. **Challenges with Multiple TimelineEntry Types**
   - The TimelineEntry interface is used across multiple components (Timeline, ProgressBar, Summary)
   - Each component has slightly different requirements for the TimelineEntry fields
   - We decided to maintain a single comprehensive TimelineEntry interface with optional fields
   - This ensures consistency and reduces maintenance overhead at the cost of some type precision

5. **Empty Props Interface Pattern**
   - For components like OfflineIndicator that currently accept no props, we created empty interfaces
   - This establishes consistency in our component API pattern
   - It provides a place to add props in the future without breaking changes
   - It makes the component's interface explicit rather than implicit
   - We discovered two different TimelineEntry interfaces being used in the codebase
   - The two interfaces have incompatible requirements (one requires activityName, another title/description)
   - This highlights a need for future consolidation work to reduce confusion

5. **Test Coverage Important During Interface Optimization**
   - Existing tests provide a safety net when optimizing interfaces
   - Adding specific interface validation tests helps ensure backward compatibility
   - Testing with both required and optional props ensures flexibility is preserved
