### Issue: Turbopack Configuration Moved from Experimental to Stable
**Date:** 2023-11-15
**Tags:** #configuration #next-js #turbopack #refactoring
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Next.js configuration was using deprecated `experimental.turbo` property
- Warning message indicated that Turbopack is now stable and should be configured at the top level
- Configuration included rules and resolveAlias settings in the experimental section

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of Next.js documentation
   - Confirmed that Turbopack is now stable and should use the top-level `turbopack` property
   - Verified that the configuration structure remains the same, just moved to a different location

2. Implementation approach
   - Created a test to verify the new configuration structure
   - Moved all settings from `experimental.turbo` to `turbopack`
   - Kept the same functionality for rules and resolveAlias

#### Resolution
- Successfully moved Turbopack configuration from `experimental.turbo` to `turbopack` at the top level
- Updated tests to verify the new configuration structure
- Removed deprecated configuration to eliminate warnings

#### Lessons Learned
- Next.js features often move from experimental to stable as they mature
- It's important to keep up with deprecation notices to ensure optimal configuration
- Test coverage for configuration helps ensure changes are properly implemented
