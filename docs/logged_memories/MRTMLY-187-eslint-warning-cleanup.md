### Post-Migration Improvement: ESLint Warning Cleanup
**Date:** 2025-05-16
**Tags:** #code-quality #eslint #typescript #refactoring
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
After completing the Next.js App Router migration, the codebase contains several ESLint warnings:
- Unused variables across multiple files
- Explicit `any` types that should be replaced with proper TypeScript types
- Unnecessary variable declarations in various components

ESLint is configured with the following rules:
```json
{
  "extends": "next/core-web-vitals",
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": ["warn", { 
      "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
      "varsIgnorePattern": "^_"
    }],
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "warn"
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Plan
1. Address each file with warnings systematically
2. For unused variables, either:
   - Remove them if truly unused
   - Prefix with underscore (_) if needed for future use or for readability
   - Use the variables appropriately if they should be used
3. For explicit `any` types:
   - Replace with more specific types where possible
   - Create interfaces for complex types
   - Use `unknown` where type cannot be determined
4. Document the changes in this memory log
