### Issue: Layout Spacing and Horizontal Scrolling Fixes
**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Tags:** #layout #spacing #ui-fixes #overflow
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
Two layout issues reported:
1. **Missing vertical space** between header and activity/timeline cards when activities are started and completed
2. **Horizontal scrolling** introduced inside the "activity-manager" card, specifically on the div with classes "flex-grow-1 overflow-auto"

#### Debug Process
1. **Analyzed current layout structure**:
   - Main page uses `row flex-grow-1 g-3 px-3 pb-3 overflow-hidden` 
   - Missing top padding (`pt-3`) was causing cards to touch the OfflineIndicator
   - ActivityManager used `overflow-auto` which allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling

2. **Created targeted tests** to verify issues and expected behavior:
   - `ActivityManager.spacing.test.tsx` - tests for container layout and overflow handling
   - `page.layout.test.tsx` - tests for main layout spacing
   - Tests confirmed horizontal scrolling issue (`overflowX` was empty instead of "hidden")

3. **Identified specific fixes needed**:
   - Add `pt-3` class to main row for vertical spacing
   - Replace `overflow-auto` with inline styles `overflowY: auto, overflowX: hidden`

#### Resolution
**Fix 1: Added vertical spacing in page.tsx**
```tsx
// Changed from: px-3 pb-3
// To: px-3 pt-3 pb-3
<div className="row flex-grow-1 g-3 px-3 pt-3 pb-3 overflow-hidden">
```

**Fix 2: Fixed horizontal scrolling in ActivityManager.tsx**
```tsx
// Changed from: className="flex-grow-1 overflow-auto"
// To: className="flex-grow-1" with inline styles
<div className="flex-grow-1" style={{ overflowY: 'auto', overflowX: 'hidden' }}>
```

**Updated corresponding tests**:
- Modified `ActivityManager.test.tsx` to expect new overflow behavior
- Added comprehensive spacing tests that verify:
  - Proper flex classes and overflow handling  
  - Prevention of horizontal scrolling
  - Maintenance of vertical spacing without increasing total height
  - Consistent card body padding

#### Validation
- ✅ All tests pass (824 tests, 1 skipped)
- ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ Fixes maintain existing functionality while solving both reported issues
- ✅ No increase in total application height
- ✅ Proper vertical spacing between header and cards
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling eliminated

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Test-driven fixes**: Writing tests first helped identify exact issues and verify solutions
2. **Bootstrap spacing**: Using Bootstrap's spacing utilities (`pt-3`) maintains consistency with existing design system
3. **Inline styles for specific overflow control**: When Bootstrap classes don't provide the exact control needed, targeted inline styles are acceptable
4. **Layout testing**: Comprehensive layout tests help catch spacing and overflow issues early
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Small fixes that maintain total height constraints while improving spacing
