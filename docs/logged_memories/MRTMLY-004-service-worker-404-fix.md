### Issue: Service Worker 404 Error Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-10-25
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #routing #spa #404
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Application showing 404 page at http://localhost:3000/
- Service worker registered but not properly handling navigation requests
- SPA routes not working correctly with service worker caching

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation
   - Identified that the service worker was registered but not handling navigation requests correctly
   - Found that 404 responses were not being intercepted to serve index.html
   - Discovered missing `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` calls causing delayed activation

2. Root cause identification
   - Service worker using too simple fetch handler that didn't differentiate between navigation and asset requests
   - No special handling for 404 responses to support SPA routing
   - No immediate activation of the service worker after installation

3. Solution implementation
   - Created a more sophisticated fetch event handler with different strategies:
     - Navigation requests: network-first with fallback to index.html on 404
     - Asset requests: cache-first with network fallback
   - Added `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` for immediate activation
   - Improved error handling for offline scenarios
   - Added cache update mechanism

#### Resolution
- Implemented a more robust service worker that properly handles SPA routing
- Added special handling for navigation requests to serve index.html on 404s
- Ensured immediate activation of service worker through skipWaiting() and clients.claim()
- Added proper error handling for network failures
- Implemented different strategies for navigation vs. asset requests

#### Lessons Learned
- Service workers need special configuration to work correctly with SPAs
- Navigation requests should use a different caching strategy than asset requests
- 404 responses need special handling to support client-side routing in SPAs
- Service worker activation can be delayed without skipWaiting() and clients.claim()
- Regular testing in different network conditions is essential for robust offline support
- Need to implement a graceful update mechanism to avoid disrupting user experience
