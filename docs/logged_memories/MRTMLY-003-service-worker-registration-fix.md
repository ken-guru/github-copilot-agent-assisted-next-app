# Service Worker Registration Fix

### Issue: Service Worker Registration Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-10-25
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #pwa #deployment
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker failing to register with 404 errors
- Console showing syntax error: `Cannot use import statement outside a module`
- Registration attempt using incorrect path: `/undefined/service-worker.js`
- Failed registration on deployed Vercel environment

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed error messages
   - Identified syntax error in service worker file
   - Found incorrect path in registration code
   - Detected potential missing service worker file

2. Solution implementation
   - Created proper service worker file in the public directory
   - Removed import statements from service worker
   - Created dedicated service worker registration module
   - Updated registration code to use correct path

#### Resolution
- Created a standard service worker without ES modules syntax
- Placed service worker in the public directory to ensure it's accessible at the root URL
- Created dedicated registration logic that uses the correct path
- Integrated registration into the app layout with proper client-side execution

#### Lessons Learned
- Service worker files must be placed in the public directory to be served from the root URL
- Import statements in service workers require using `type="module"` or avoiding ES modules syntax
- Next.js requires client-side registration of service workers
- The path to the service worker must be absolute from the domain root
