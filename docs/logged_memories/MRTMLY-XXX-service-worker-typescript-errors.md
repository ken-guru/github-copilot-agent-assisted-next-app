### Issue: Service Worker TypeScript Errors Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-MM-DD
**Tags:** #debugging #typescript #service-worker
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- TypeScript errors found in service worker related files during `npm run type-check`
- Key issues:
  1. Mock ServiceWorkerRegistration in tests missing required properties
  2. Promise return type issues in serviceWorkerCore.ts

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed TypeScript errors
   - Examined error messages pointing to interface implementation issues
   - Identified Promise chain return type mismatches

2. Fixed test mock implementation
   - Created proper ServiceWorker mock with all required properties
   - Enhanced ServiceWorkerRegistration mock with properly typed properties
   - Used type assertion with unknown to avoid type errors while maintaining test integrity

3. Fixed Promise return type issues
   - Modified Promise chain to consistently return Promise<void>
   - Wrapped implementation in a new Promise to ensure consistent return types
   - Fixed typings in Promise chain handlers

#### Resolution
- All TypeScript errors resolved while maintaining existing functionality
- Test suite runs successfully with fixed mocks
- Type safety improved for service worker registration and update handling

#### Lessons Learned
- When mocking browser APIs, ensure all required interface properties are implemented
- Promise chains need consistent return types throughout the chain
- Type assertions should be used carefully with proper intermediate typing (unknown)
- Complex browser APIs like Service Workers require thorough typing to ensure correctness
