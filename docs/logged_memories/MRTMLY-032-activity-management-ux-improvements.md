# MRTMLY-032: Activity Management UX Improvements

**Date:** 2025-01-12
**Tags:** #ux-improvements #bootstrap #cards #theme-toggle #activity-management
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Activity management pages had inconsistent spacing and card layouts
- Theme toggle states did not consistently apply across activity cards
- Some controls had uneven padding and alignment

## Debug Process
1. Audited Activity CRUD UI against design tokens and spacing system
2. Unified card structure using Bootstrap utilities and consistent spacing variables
3. Verified theme reactivity across activity lists and controls
4. Adjusted padding and alignment for button groups and form controls

## Resolution
- Standardized card layout with Bootstrap 5 utilities
- Ensured theme toggle updates are applied to activity items
- Fixed minor padding inconsistencies in control areas

## Lessons Learned
- Centralizing spacing via variables prevents drift
- Theme reactivity should be validated on components not just page root
