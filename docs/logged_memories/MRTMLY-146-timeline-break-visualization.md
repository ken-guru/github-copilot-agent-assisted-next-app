### Issue: MRTMLY-013: Timeline Break Visualization Fix
**Date:** 2025-03-02
**Tags:** #timeline #visualization #breaks #real-time-updates
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Timeline component not correctly visualizing breaks between activities
- Break durations calculated incorrectly
- Visual gaps inconsistent with actual time differences
- Real-time updates causing break visualization to disappear

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated timeline visualization logic
   - Found break calculation using incorrect time comparison
   - Identified missing handling for concurrent update scenarios
   - Determined real-time refresh overwriting break visualization

2. Solution attempts
   - Fixed break duration calculation
     - Updated time difference algorithm
     - Added proper handling of timezone considerations
     - Outcome: Improved but still visual inconsistencies
     - Issue: Rendering logic still problematic

   - Updated rendering approach
     - Separated data calculation from rendering
     - Implemented memoization for break calculations
     - Outcome: Better but real-time updates still causing issues
     - Why: Component lifecycle not properly handling updates

   - Implemented comprehensive timeline rendering solution
     - Created dedicated break visualization component
     - Added proper lifecycle management for real-time updates
     - Implemented intelligent diffing for timeline changes
     - Added visual indicators for different break durations
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all visualization issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Accurate break duration calculation with timezone awareness
  - Dedicated BreakIndicator component with proper lifecycle
  - Intelligent update handling to preserve break visualization
  - Visual styling based on break duration categories
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all break scenarios
- Timeline now correctly visualizes breaks with consistent behavior

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Time-based visualizations need careful timezone handling
  - Real-time updates require special consideration for persistent elements
  - Break data should be calculated and cached separately from rendering
- Future considerations:
  - Implement user configuration for break visualization thresholds
  - Consider more sophisticated timeline rendering engine
  - Add interactive features for break inspection
