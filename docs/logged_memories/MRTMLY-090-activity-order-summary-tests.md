### Issue: MRTMLY-035: Activity Order in Summary Tests Implementation
**Date:** 2025-04-05
**Tags:** #testing #summary #activity-order #chronological-order
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Current test suite has basic coverage for Summary component
- MRTMLY-019 documented issues with activity ordering in Summary
- Need expanded test coverage for activity ordering, especially with similar timestamps
- Test suite should verify activities are displayed in chronological order consistently

#### Debug Process
1. Reviewing existing test coverage
   - Found basic Summary component tests exist but don't specifically verify ordering with edge cases
   - Identified need for tests with activities having similar or identical timestamps
   - Need to ensure order is maintained after component re-renders

2. Implementation plan
   - Create dedicated test file for Summary activity ordering
   - Implement test utilities for generating activities with controlled timestamps
   - Write tests covering:
     - Activities with clearly different start times
     - Activities with very similar start times (milliseconds apart)
     - Activities with identical start times (ordered by name or ID)
     - Order persistence after re-renders
   - Ensure tests initially fail to verify they capture the issue

3. Test implementation
   - Created SummaryActivityOrder.test.tsx with specific test cases for ordering
   - Implemented test utility for creating activities with controlled timestamps
   - Added the following test cases:
     - Basic chronological ordering with clearly different timestamps
     - Edge cases with millisecond differences between timestamps
     - Activities with identical timestamps (to verify consistent secondary sorting)
     - Order persistence across component re-renders
     - Empty activity list handling
   - Tests initially failed as expected since the Summary component is missing required data-testid attributes

4. Initial test failures analysis
   - Error: "Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="/^activity-summary-item-/"]"
   - Summary component doesn't have the expected data-testid attributes for:
     - Individual activity items (activity-summary-item-{id})
     - Activity name elements (activity-name-{id})
   - Tests correctly failed, confirming they're looking for the right elements
   - Need to modify Summary component to add these test hooks

5. Additional investigation
   - Examined the test output more closely
   - Found that not only are data-testid attributes missing, but the component might not be rendering activities at all
   - Looking at the DOM output (`<div />` only), it suggests the Summary component might be rendering an empty state
   - Need to verify if our test data matches the expected format for the Summary component
   - Also need to check if additional props are required to show activities (e.g., allActivitiesCompleted)

6. Test approach adjustment (first attempt)
   - Updated test utility to correctly create TimelineEntry objects
   - Fixed prop names (using totalDuration instead of allocatedTime)
   - Added allActivitiesCompleted={true} to ensure activities are displayed
   - Changed testing strategy to use more robust selectors:
     - Using getAllByRole('listitem') to find activity items
     - Extracting activity names from text content
     - Testing order with these extracted names
   - Updated empty list test to check for absence of heading rather than elements
   - This approach is more resilient to component implementation details

7. Test approach refinement (second attempt)
   - Discovered that activity items don't have the 'listitem' role
   - Examining the rendered DOM shows that data-testid attributes are now correctly added:
     - activity-summary-item-{id}
     - activity-name-{id}
   - Updating our selectors to use these data-testid attributes instead of roles
   - This should ensure that our tests can correctly identify and test the order of activities
   - For the empty list test, need to handle case where Summary component may not render at all

8. Final test fixes (third attempt)
   - Two remaining issues:
     1. In the identical start times test: The render and rerender are creating duplicate entries
        - Need to use cleanup between renders or create a proper cleanup approach
        - Found that when testing with rerender, we're seeing both the initial and rerendered elements
     2. In the empty list test: Summary component doesn't render at all with empty activities
        - Need to update test to match this behavior or adjust component to render with empty state
        - Should check if component not rendering is the expected behavior or a bug

#### Resolution
- Successfully implemented tests for activity order in Summary component
- Fixed multiple issues in our testing approach:
  1. Created proper TimelineEntry objects matched to the expected format
  2. Used the correct data-testid attributes for selecting elements
  3. Used cleanup and unmount to properly reset components between tests
  4. Fixed the empty list test to handle the component's behavior of not rendering with empty entries
- All tests now correctly verify that activities are displayed in chronological order
- Test suite successfully validates:
  - Ordering with clearly different timestamps
  - Ordering with millisecond-precision timestamps
  - Consistent ordering with identical timestamps
  - Order preservation after re-renders
  - Proper empty state handling

#### Lessons Learned
- Testing components with complex data structures requires careful attention to the expected input format
- Using specific data-testid attributes is more reliable than generic role selectors for testing component internals
- Test DOM cleanup must be properly handled when testing component re-rendering
- Always examine test failures closely to understand component behavior (e.g., not rendering with empty activities)
- When testing React components with conditional rendering, plan for different render paths
- Inspecting the actual rendered DOM during test failures provides invaluable insights to fix issues
