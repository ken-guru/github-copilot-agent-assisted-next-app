### Issue: MRTMLY-039: Idle Time Calculation Test Suite Implementation
**Date:** 2025-04-03
**Tags:** #testing #idle-time #breaks #edge-cases #time-accounting
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Current application has functionality to calculate idle time between activities
- The test suite expansion plan identifies the need for explicit tests for idle time calculations
- No dedicated tests exist specifically targeting idle time calculation edge cases
- Idle time calculations are critical for accurate time reporting in the Summary component

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed existing code for idle time calculations
   - Initially looked for utility functions in timeUtils.ts
   - Discovered idle time calculation is handled directly in the Summary component
   - Found that calculations use the `calculateActivityStats` method within the component
   - Revised test approach to test the component's rendering output instead

2. First implementation attempt
   - Created unit tests targeting a non-existent utility function
   - Attempted to test the calculation logic in isolation
   - Outcome: Test failures due to incorrect function import
   - Issue: Misunderstood where the idle time calculation was implemented

3. Second implementation attempt
   - Switched to component testing approach using React Testing Library
   - Rendered the Summary component with different activity patterns
   - Outcome: Syntax errors due to JSX usage in .ts files
   - Issue: JSX requires .tsx extension or specific babel configuration

4. Final implementation approach
   - Created a standalone implementation of the idle time calculation logic
   - Extracted the core algorithm from Summary component into the test file
   - Applied Date.now() mocking for deterministic results
   - Used the same test scenarios to verify calculation correctness:
     - No breaks between activities
     - Single break between activities
     - Multiple breaks between activities
     - Ongoing breaks
     - Zero-duration activities
     - Activities out of chronological order
     - Overlapping activities

#### Next Steps
- Run the revised tests to verify they properly test the idle time calculation logic
- Check if any tests fail, indicating bugs in the current implementation
- Compare the test implementation against the actual Summary component implementation
- Identify any discrepancies that could indicate bugs in the production code
- Document any bugs found and their solutions in the Memory Log

#### Lessons Learned
- Important to understand the actual implementation structure before writing tests
- Component-level calculations may not be extracted into utility functions
- JSX syntax requires proper file extensions (.tsx) or configuration
- Extract core algorithms for unit testing when component testing isn't feasible
- Idle time calculations have several edge cases that need explicit testing
- Testing chronological and non-chronological data is important for robust time calculations
- When testing component logic, consider directly testing the underlying algorithm
