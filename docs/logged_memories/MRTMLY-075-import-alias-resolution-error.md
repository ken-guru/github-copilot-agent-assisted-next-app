### Issue: Import Alias Resolution Error in Next.js
**Date:** 2025-04-08
**Tags:** #debugging #next-js #imports #module-resolution #typescript
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Application is showing 500 error when accessing http://localhost:3000/
- Terminal showing module resolution error: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/contexts/LoadingContext'"
- Next.js attempts to resolve @/ alias to './src/' but fails to find the modules
- Import map shows it's being aliased to './src/contexts/LoadingContext' which seems correct but isn't working

#### Debug Process
1. Investigating the module resolution error
   - Error occurs when trying to import using the @/ path alias in src/app/page.tsx
   - The error specifically mentions LoadingContext but likely affects all @/ imports
   - Next.js is correctly identifying the alias mapping to './src/' but can't resolve the files

2. Examining tsconfig.json and next.config.ts for path configuration
   - Need to verify path aliases are correctly configured in tsconfig.json
   - Check if there's any conflicting configuration in next.config.ts
   - Determine if the issue is with the alias configuration or file structure

3. Identified directory structure mismatch
   - LoadingContext.tsx exists in /contexts/ directory at project root
   - Import statement in src/app/page.tsx is using @/contexts/LoadingContext
   - @/ alias correctly maps to ./src/ but src/contexts/ directory doesn't exist
   - This mismatch is causing the 500 error when trying to load the application

4. Potential solutions
   - Option 1: Move components from root directories to src/ directory structure
   - Option 2: Update tsconfig.json paths to point to the root directories
   - Option 3: Update import statements to use relative paths
   
   Implementing Option 2 since it requires minimal changes and maintains the existing project structure
