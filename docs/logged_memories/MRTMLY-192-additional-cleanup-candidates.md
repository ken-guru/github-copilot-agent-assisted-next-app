### Issue: Additional Cleanup Candidates Analysis and Migration Planning
**Date:** 2025-04-29
**Tags:** #maintenance #cleanup #code-quality
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
During the previous cleanup process (MRTMLY-191), several additional files were identified as candidates for future pruning:

1. **`deprecated-utils/`**
   - Location: `/src/utils/deprecated-utils/`
   - Current status: Some utilities are still imported, but marked as deprecated in comments
   - Recommendation: Create gradual migration plan to replace with modern alternatives

2. **`beta-features/`**
   - Location: `/src/features/beta-features/`
   - Current status: Contains experimental features from previous development cycles
   - Recommendation: Evaluate which features should be promoted to production status and which should be removed

3. **`old-test-helpers.js`**
   - Location: `/test/helpers/old-test-helpers.js`
   - Current status: Appears to contain outdated test helper functions
   - Recommendation: Verify if any tests still depend on these helpers and plan migration

4. **Draft documentation files**
   - Location: `/docs/drafts/`
   - Current status: Contains incomplete documentation from previous features
   - Recommendation: Complete relevant documentation or remove outdated drafts

#### Implementation Plan

Following the detailed plan outlined in MRTMLY-191, this cleanup effort will be executed in four phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Analysis and Documentation
2. **Phase 2**: Migration Planning
3. **Phase 3**: Execution Plan
4. **Phase 4**: Verification and Reporting

This memory log entry will track progress through all phases and document findings, decisions, and results.

#### Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation
##### Deprecated Utils Analysis

- Executing script to find all imports:
  ```bash
  grep -r "from '.*deprecated-utils" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/
  ```
- Results pending...
- Utility documentation pending...
- Usage frequency calculation pending...
- Analysis results will be documented in `/docs/analysis/deprecated-utils-usage.md`

##### Beta Features Analysis

- Executing script to find all imports:
  ```bash
  grep -r "from '.*beta-features" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/
  ```
- Results pending...
- Feature documentation pending...
- Commit history checks pending...
- Usage categorization pending...
- Analysis results will be documented in `/docs/analysis/beta-features-status.md`

##### Test Helpers Analysis

- Executing script to find all imports:
  ```bash
  grep -r "from '.*old-test-helpers" --include="*.test.js" --include="*.spec.js" --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts" test/
  ```
- Results pending...
- Test documentation pending...
- Modern equivalent identification pending...
- Analysis results will be documented in `/docs/analysis/test-helpers-usage.md`

##### Draft Documentation Analysis

- File listing pending...
- Modification date checking pending...
- Feature existence verification pending...
- Content relevance determination pending...
- Analysis results will be documented in `/docs/analysis/draft-docs-status.md`

#### Next Steps

1. Complete all analysis tasks in Phase 1
2. Create analysis documentation files
3. Proceed to Migration Planning in Phase 2

#### Resolution
Resolution pending completion of all phases.

#### Lessons Learned
Lessons learned will be documented upon completion of the cleanup process.
