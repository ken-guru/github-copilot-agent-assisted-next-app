### Issue: MRTMLY-029: Service Worker Registration Test Console Error Fix
**Date:** 2025-03-25
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #service-worker #test-mocking
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker registration tests producing console errors
- Error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of undefined"
- Tests passing but polluting console output
- Inconsistent behavior between test runs

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated console errors
   - Found incomplete mocking of registration.installing property
   - Identified event listener being attached to undefined object
   - Determined test cleanup not properly restoring mocks

2. Solution attempts
   - Enhanced mock implementation
     - Added missing registration.installing property
     - Implemented proper event target interface
     - Outcome: Reduced errors but still some console noise
     - Issue: State transitions not properly simulated

   - Improved service worker state handling
     - Implemented proper state transition simulation
     - Added complete event target implementation
     - Outcome: Better but test pollution between runs
     - Why: Global mock state not reset between tests

   - Comprehensive mock environment isolation
     - Created isolated mock factory with complete reset
     - Implemented proper test boundary cleanup
     - Added silent error handling for expected test scenarios
     - Enhanced console filtering during tests
     - Outcome: Successfully eliminated all console errors

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Complete service worker registration mock
  - Proper state transition simulation
  - Isolated test environment for each test
  - Comprehensive mock cleanup between tests
  - Console filtering for expected error patterns
- All tests now running cleanly without console pollution

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Service worker mocks need complete event target implementation
  - Test isolation requires comprehensive mock state reset
  - Expected errors should be properly handled or filtered
- Future considerations:
  - Create standardized service worker testing utilities
  - Implement more sophisticated console filtering for tests
  - Consider moving to more isolated testing approach
