### Issue: Test Infrastructure Improvements Session
**Date:** 2023-11-16
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #mocking #layout #theme

#### Initial State
- Multiple test failures across several components:
  - SplashScreen tests failing due to missing theme utility module
  - Layout tests failing due to metadata title mismatch ("Activity Tracker" vs "Mr. Timely")
  - Layout tests failing due to missing icon configuration
  - ThemeToggle tests failing with issues in mocking local storage and classList
  - ThemeToggle tests reference MediaQueryListEvent which is undefined in the test environment

#### Debug Process
1. Theme utilities investigation
   - The utility module for theme management was referenced but did not exist
   - Created a comprehensive theme utility with functions for detecting and switching themes
   - Added proper type checking and browser environment checks

2. Layout metadata investigation
   - Tests expected application name to be "Mr. Timely" but it was "Activity Tracker"
   - Tests expected icons and manifest configurations that were missing
   - Updated metadata configuration to match expected values in tests

3. ThemeToggle test issues investigation
   - localStorage mocking was incomplete, missing Jest mock functions
   - MediaQueryListEvent is not available in the Jest environment
   - Theme application state (dark/light mode) was not being properly tracked in tests

4. Mock component name inconsistency
   - Layout tests expected LayoutClient component to have a property name='LayoutClient'
   - Component mocking needed to set displayName for proper identification

#### Resolution
1. Created theme utility module with the following functions:
   - isDarkTheme() - detect if dark theme is active
   - applyDarkTheme() - apply dark theme to document
   - applyLightTheme() - apply light theme to document
   - clearTheme() - remove all theme classes

2. Updated layout metadata configuration:
   - Changed title to "Mr. Timely"
   - Added proper description
   - Added icon configurations
   - Added manifest path

3. Improved ThemeToggle test mocking:
   - Created proper localStorage mock with Jest functions
   - Added state tracking for theme classes
   - Fixed MediaQueryListEvent references with a generic event type
   - Added proper simulation of theme application in tests

4. Fixed component mocking in tests:
   - Added proper displayName to mocked LayoutClient
   - Ensured mocks export correctly as ESM modules

#### Lessons Learned
- Tests drive implementation details - tests expected specific application name and metadata
- Theme state management requires careful mocking in a test environment
- Browser APIs like MediaQueryListEvent need special handling in Node.js test environments
- Component naming and identification in tests is important for proper assertions
- Always check for missing modules when tests reference non-existent paths
