### Issue: MRTMLY-006: Service Worker Update Retry Implementation
**Date:** 2024-11-12
**Tags:** #service-worker #retry-mechanism #error-handling #reliability
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker updates fail silently when network issues occur
- No retry mechanism for failed updates, requiring manual refresh
- Users experience outdated app versions after failed updates

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated service worker registration process
   - Found no error handling around update check
   - Identified lack of retry logic for failed updates
   - Determined network errors were being swallowed

2. Solution attempts
   - Implemented simple exponential backoff retry
     - Added catch block with setTimeout for retry
     - Outcome: Basic retries worked but lacked sophistication
     - Issue: No maximum retry limit or awareness of network state

   - Added maximum retry count and logging
     - Implemented max retry count of 5 with exponential delay
     - Added detailed logging for debugging
     - Outcome: Better but still retried when offline
     - Why: Needed to be network-aware to avoid wasting resources

   - Added network status check before retry
     - Used navigator.onLine to check connectivity
     - Added event listeners for online/offline events
     - Outcome: Success, intelligent retry based on network status

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter for retry spacing
  - Maximum retry limit (5 attempts)
  - Network status awareness to pause retries when offline
  - Retry queue resumes when online status is detected
  - Detailed logging for debugging
- Tests added to verify retry behavior with mocked network conditions

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Always implement proper error handling for network operations
  - Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming servers during issues
  - Network status awareness is essential for mobile-friendly apps
- Future considerations:
  - Consider implementing a more sophisticated offline experience
  - Add analytics to track update success/failure rates
  - Create more granular controls for update behavior
