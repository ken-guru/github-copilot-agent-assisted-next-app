### Issue: MRTMLY-023: Timeline Calculation Test Update for Break Visualization
**Date:** 2025-03-10
**Tags:** #testing #timeline #breaks #interactions
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Tests failing for timeline calculations after break visualization improvements
- Inconsistent test expectations for time gaps
- Test data not properly reflecting real-world scenarios
- Missing test coverage for edge cases in break visualization

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed failing tests
   - Found outdated test expectations for break durations
   - Identified incomplete test scenarios for time gaps
   - Determined need for more comprehensive test data

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated test expectations
     - Aligned test assertions with new calculation logic
     - Fixed time comparison in tests
     - Outcome: Some tests fixed but still inconsistencies
     - Issue: Test environment time handling causing issues

   - Improved test time management
     - Implemented consistent time mocking
     - Added timezone-aware test helpers
     - Outcome: Better but edge cases still failing
     - Why: Some test scenarios incomplete

   - Comprehensive test suite overhaul
     - Created factory functions for timeline test data
     - Implemented complete test coverage for all break scenarios
     - Added visual regression tests for break visualization
     - Added edge case testing for boundary conditions
     - Outcome: Successfully comprehensive test coverage

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Comprehensive test suite for break calculations
  - Time manipulation utilities for consistent testing
  - Factory functions for test data generation
  - Visual snapshot tests for break visualization
  - Edge case coverage for all calculation scenarios
- All tests now passing with consistent behavior

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Time-based tests need careful control and consistent approaches
  - Visual components require both calculation and appearance testing
  - Test data factories improve test maintainability
- Future considerations:
  - Create standardized time testing utilities
  - Implement more sophisticated visual regression testing
  - Consider property-based testing for complex calculations
