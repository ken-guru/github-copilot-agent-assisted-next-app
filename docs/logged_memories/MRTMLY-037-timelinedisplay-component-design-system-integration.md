### Issue: TimelineDisplay Component Design System Integration
**Date:** 2025-06-16
**Tags:** #design-system #timeline #component-integration #accessibility
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
The TimelineDisplay component was using traditional CSS classes and needed integration with the design system:
- Component used `className="timeline-display"`, `className="timeline-event"`, etc.
- No accessibility enhancements (ARIA labels, semantic elements)
- Missing responsive design and visual timeline representation
- Basic component structure without mobile-first considerations
- Tests passing but component unstyled

#### Implementation Process
1. **CSS Module Creation**
   - Created comprehensive `TimelineDisplay.module.css` with mobile-first design
   - Implemented visual timeline with connecting lines and event markers
   - Added hover states, focus management, and responsive adjustments
   - Integrated design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and shadows
   - Included dark mode, reduced motion, high contrast, and print styles

2. **Component Enhancement**
   - Updated import to include CSS module
   - Enhanced semantic structure: `<section>`, `<article>`, `<h3>`, `<time>`
   - Added comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Implemented proper focus management with `tabIndex={0}`
   - Enhanced empty state with better accessibility
   - Added detailed `aria-label` for screen readers

3. **Visual Design Features**
   - Timeline visualization with connecting lines between events
   - Event marker dots with visual hierarchy
   - Hover effects with subtle animations
   - Responsive padding and spacing adjustments
   - Enhanced date display with visual styling
   - Proper color contrast for accessibility

#### Resolution
Successfully integrated TimelineDisplay with the design system:
- ✅ All 5 component tests continue to pass
- ✅ Full test suite passes (466/466 tests)
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive accessibility features added
- ✅ Visual timeline representation with connecting elements
- ✅ Dark mode, reduced motion, and high contrast support
- ✅ Print styles for better document output
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML structure

#### Lessons Learned
- Timeline components benefit from visual connecting elements for better UX
- Proper `<time>` elements with `dateTime` attributes improve accessibility
- Focus management is crucial for keyboard navigation in timeline interfaces
- Visual markers help users understand temporal relationships
- Responsive timeline designs should prioritize readability on mobile devices
- Print styles are important for documentation and archival purposes
