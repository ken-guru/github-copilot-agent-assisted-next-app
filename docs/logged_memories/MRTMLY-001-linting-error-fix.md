### Issue: Linting Error in timeUtils.ts Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-11-01
**Tags:** #debugging #linting #tests #timeUtils
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build fails due to ESLint error in src/utils/testUtils/timeUtils.ts
- Error message: 'mainFormatTimeFromMs' is defined but never used
- Function exists in test utilities but wasn't exported or used

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of the error
   - Identified that the function was defined in the test utilities
   - Function appears to be intended for use in tests
   - No exports were present for the function

2. Solution attempts
   - Added export statement to the function
   - This makes the function available for import in test files

#### Resolution
- Added export statement to the mainFormatTimeFromMs function
- This resolved the linting error by making the function part of the module's public API
- Build now completes successfully

#### Lessons Learned
- Test utilities should be properly exported if they're intended for use
- ESLint is correctly identifying unused code which could lead to maintenance issues
- When creating utility functions, always consider whether they should be exported
