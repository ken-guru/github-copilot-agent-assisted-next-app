### Issue: MRTMLY-005: Service Worker Update Error Debugging Session
**Date:** 2024-11-05
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #error-handling
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker updates failing silently
- Console error: "TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker"
- Users not receiving application updates
- No error handling or recovery mechanism in place

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated service worker registration code
   - Found registration being called without error handling
   - Identified multiple registration attempts causing conflicts
   - Determined network failures weren't being handled

2. Solution attempts
   - Added basic try/catch error handling
     - Wrapped registration in try/catch
     - Added console.error for failed registration
     - Outcome: Errors now visible but still no recovery
     - Issue: Users still stuck with outdated application

   - Implemented registration status checking
     - Added check for existing registration before attempting new one
     - Created helper to verify registration state
     - Outcome: Reduced duplicate registration attempts
     - Why: Still failed completely when network was unavailable

   - Added detailed error classification
     - Created specific handling for different error types
     - Implemented user-facing error messages
     - Outcome: Better visibility but recovery still manual
     - Next steps: Need automated retry mechanism

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
  - Automatic detection of outdated service workers
  - User notification for manual update when automatic update fails
  - Detailed logging for debugging future issues
- Created foundation for retry mechanism (implemented in MRTMLY-006)

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Service worker registration needs robust error handling
  - Different error types require different recovery strategies
  - Users need visibility when automatic updates fail
- Future considerations:
  - Implement automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Add network status awareness to prevent unnecessary retries
  - Create more user-friendly update experience
