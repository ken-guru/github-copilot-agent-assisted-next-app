# Shadow Token System Implementation

**Date:** 2023-12-16
**Tags:** #css #design-system #tokens #shadows #ui
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Shadow usage was inconsistent across the application
- No clear pattern for when to use different shadow intensities
- Shadow values were hardcoded rather than using token variables
- Need for systematic approach based on element nesting and hierarchy

## Implementation Process
1. Created a comprehensive shadow token system
   - Defined a 5-point shadow scale (plus a "none" option)
   - Created semantic shadow variables for different UI contexts
   - Added different shadow values for light and dark themes
   - Specialized shadow variable for focus states

2. Defined clear usage guidelines
   - Created rules for shadow usage based on element nesting
   - Established visual hierarchy guidelines
   - Added responsive design considerations
   - Documented theme-specific adaptations

3. Updated CSS files across the application
   - Replaced hardcoded shadow values with token variables
   - Applied semantic shadow names based on component context
   - Ensured consistent elevation model throughout the interface
   - Maintained specialized focus shadows for accessibility

4. Enhanced documentation
   - Added shadow token documentation to design token docs
   - Created comprehensive usage guidelines
   - Provided examples for different UI scenarios
   - Included visual hierarchy considerations

## Resolution
- Successfully implemented a consistent shadow token system
- Created clear guidelines for shadow usage based on element nesting
- Applied appropriate shadow tokens throughout the application
- Maintained visual hierarchy through consistent shadow application
- Enhanced the design token documentation with shadow guidelines

## Lessons Learned
- Shadow intensity should correspond to element elevation in the UI
- Modal dialogs and floating elements need stronger shadows for clear separation
- Focus states benefit from specialized shadow treatment for accessibility
- Dark mode requires adjusted shadow values for better visual comfort
- A systematic approach to shadows enhances the overall UI cohesion
