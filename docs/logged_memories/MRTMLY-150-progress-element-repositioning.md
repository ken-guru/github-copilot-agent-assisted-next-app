### Issue: MRTMLY-022: Progress Element Repositioning for Mobile Optimization
**Date:** 2025-03-21
**Tags:** #mobile #layout #progress-bar #optimization
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Progress element positioned poorly on mobile devices
- Taking up too much vertical space on small screens
- Layout breaking at certain viewport widths
- User experience compromised on mobile devices

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed current progress element layout
   - Found fixed height and width causing layout issues
   - Identified positioning causing content displacement
   - Determined need for mobile-specific layout approach

2. Solution attempts
   - Applied responsive CSS adjustments
     - Implemented percentage-based widths
     - Added media queries for different viewport sizes
     - Outcome: Improved but still usability issues
     - Issue: Element still taking valuable vertical space

   - Tried alternative positioning approach
     - Moved element to fixed position at top of viewport
     - Added transition for smooth appearance
     - Outcome: Better but affected other UI elements
     - Why: Position fixed creating new layout problems

   - Implemented comprehensive mobile optimization
     - Created adaptive layout based on viewport size
     - Used sticky positioning with proper z-index management
     - Implemented collapsible behavior on mobile
     - Added touch-friendly interaction areas
     - Outcome: Successfully optimized for all viewport sizes

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Adaptive positioning based on viewport size
  - Collapsible behavior to save space on mobile
  - Touch-friendly interaction areas
  - Smooth transitions between states
- Progress element now enhancing rather than hindering mobile experience

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Mobile layouts need fundamentally different approaches, not just scaling
  - Vertical space is premium on mobile and should be preserved
  - Touch interactions require different sizing than mouse interactions
- Future considerations:
  - Create standardized mobile component variants
  - Implement more sophisticated responsive behavior system
  - Consider gesture-based interactions for mobile
