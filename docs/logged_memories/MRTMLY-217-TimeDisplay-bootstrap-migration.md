**Date:** 2023-09-15
**Tags:** #bootstrap-migration #component #ui #testing
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- The TimeDisplay component was using custom CSS classes for styling
- Custom CSS classes were being removed as part of the Bootstrap migration
- TimeDisplay needed to be updated to use Bootstrap components and utility classes
- Tests needed to be updated to handle the new Bootstrap components

#### Migration Process
1. Examined the current TimeDisplay component implementation
   - Identified component's structure and functionality
   - Noted custom CSS classes and styling that needed to be replaced
   - Reviewed variant and status prop handling

2. Updated the TimeDisplay tests
   - Added mocks for Bootstrap components (Card, Badge)
   - Adjusted test expectations to match the new component structure
   - Added additional tests for variant and status props

3. Migrated the TimeDisplay component
   - Replaced div elements with appropriate Bootstrap components
   - Used Card component for card variant
   - Used Badge component for status indicators
   - Applied Bootstrap utility classes for spacing and text styling
   - Preserved all existing functionality

4. Fixed type errors
   - Updated getStatusColor function to return proper types for Badge component
   - Ensured all props were properly typed

5. Ran tests to verify the migration
   - All tests passed for the TimeDisplay component
   - Verified that the component still worked as expected

6. Updated documentation
   - Updated the component documentation to reflect Bootstrap integration
   - Added information about new Bootstrap-specific features

#### Resolution
The TimeDisplay component was successfully migrated to use Bootstrap components and utility classes. All tests are passing, and the component maintains its original functionality while now using Bootstrap for styling.

#### Lessons Learned
- Bootstrap component mocks need to be created for each test file
- When replacing custom CSS with Bootstrap, it's important to maintain all existing functionality
- The Badge component in react-bootstrap requires specific variant types
- Test files need to be updated to account for the new DOM structure with Bootstrap components
