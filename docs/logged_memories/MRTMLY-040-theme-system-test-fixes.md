### Issue: MRTMLY-040: Theme System Test Suite Failures
**Date:** 2025-04-02
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #theme-system #localStorage #context
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Several tests in the ThemeContext test suite are failing:
  - Theme state is not updating correctly when set via button clicks
  - localStorage mocking is not being properly recognized in tests
  - CSS classes for dark/light mode aren't being applied correctly
  - System preference detection has issues in test environment
- These failures impact multiple components that depend on theme functionality

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation
   - Examined ThemeContext implementation and test files
   - Found issue with localStorage access in tests - mock implementation doesn't match actual usage
   - CSS classes not being applied due to timing issues in the test environment
   - System preference mocking implementation isn't properly detected

2. First attempt - Update localStorage mocking
   - Modified ThemeContext tests to use mockImplementation instead of mockReturnValueOnce
   - This allows more consistent mocking of the localStorage.getItem behavior
   - Challenge: Tests still fail as theme isn't being updated properly

3. Second attempt - Fix theme state updates
   - Will improve ThemeContext implementation to handle state updates more reliably
   - Need to ensure theme changes are reflected immediately in test environment
   - Will add explicit DOM class application to ensure visual changes are consistent

4. Third attempt - Improve system preference handling
   - Need to ensure system preference mocking is properly detected in tests
   - Will modify the test implementation to more accurately simulate media queries
   - This should help with tests that verify theme changes in response to system preferences

#### Resolution (if reached)
- TBD
