### Issue: MRTMLY-033: Theme System TypeScript Error Resolution
**Date:** 2025-04-01
**Tags:** #typescript #theming #testing #fixes
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Multiple TypeScript errors in theme-related components
- Issues with useTheme hook type definitions
- Missing exports and incorrect imports in theme context
- Test files failing type checks

#### Debug Process
1. Theme Context Issues
   - Found missing type exports from ThemeContext
   - Identified incorrect import paths
   - Discovered useTheme hook lacked proper type definitions
   - Solution: Added proper type exports and fixed import paths

2. useTheme Hook Implementation
   - Initial attempt: Direct re-export of useThemeContext
   - Issue: Missing proper type definitions
   - Solution: Added explicit ThemeContext interface
   - Added proper type annotations to useTheme export

3. Test File Path Resolution
   - Found incorrect import paths in test files
   - Issue: TypeScript unable to resolve module paths
   - Solution: Updated import paths to use relative paths
   - Added proper type annotations to test mock objects

#### Resolution
Final solution implemented:
- Complete type definitions for theme context
- Proper hook exports with type safety
- Unified theme interface across components
- Fixed test file module resolution

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Always export type definitions alongside context
  - Keep interface definitions close to implementation
  - Use relative paths in test files for better resolution
  - Mock objects need proper type definitions
- Future considerations:
  - Create central type definition file for theme system
  - Add type checking to CI pipeline
  - Consider using TypeScript path aliases in tests
  - Implement automated type coverage checks
