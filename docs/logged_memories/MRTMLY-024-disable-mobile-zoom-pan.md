# MRTMLY-024: Disabling Zoom and Pan on Mobile Devices

**Date:** 2025-04-10  
**Tags:** #mobile #viewport #accessibility #ux  
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Users were able to zoom and pan on mobile devices
- This could lead to poor UX when users accidentally zoom/pan during interaction with the app
- No configuration to prevent this behavior existed in the viewport settings

## Implementation Process
1. First identified the appropriate location to modify viewport configuration
   - Located the viewport configuration in `src/app/layout.tsx`
   - Determined Next.js viewport metadata supported the needed properties

2. Created test for the new functionality
   - Added test that verifies `userScalable: false` and `maximumScale: 1` properties
   - Test initially failed as expected in test-first development

3. Implemented the solution
   - Added the required properties to the viewport configuration
   - Ran tests to confirm implementation passed

## Resolution
- Added two key properties to the viewport metadata:
  - `userScalable: false` to prevent users from scaling the viewport
  - `maximumScale: 1` to ensure the viewport stays at its initial scale
- Test now passes, confirming the configuration is correctly set
- All unit tests in the project still pass following this change

## Lessons Learned
- Next.js provides a clean way to configure viewport settings through metadata exports
- Setting `userScalable: false` combined with `maximumScale: 1` effectively prevents zoom and pan on mobile devices
- While this improves the app experience for most users, it's important to note this may impact accessibility for users who need zooming capabilities

## Accessibility Considerations
This change improves the general user experience by preventing accidental zooming/panning but may impact users who rely on zoom functionality for accessibility reasons. Consider:
- Ensuring all text meets minimum size requirements (at least 16px)
- Maintaining sufficient color contrast
- Providing alternative ways to access content that might need magnification
- Adding a user preference option to enable zooming if needed in future enhancement
