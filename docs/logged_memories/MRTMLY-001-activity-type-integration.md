# Memory Log Entry: Activity Type Integration and Color Handling Refactor

**Date:** 2025-07-15
**Tags:** #integration #activity-type #color-system #refactor #tests #docs
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Multiple components and tests referenced a non-canonical Activity type with a `colors` property.
- Canonical Activity type defined in `src/types/activity.ts` did not include `colors`.
- Type errors and test failures occurred due to mismatched properties and missing required fields.
- Documentation referenced outdated Activity type and color handling.

## Debug Process
1. Located all files importing Activity from incorrect sources and referencing `colors`.
2. Refactored all imports to use canonical Activity type from `src/types/activity.ts`.
3. Updated all components and tests to derive color sets from `colorIndex` using `getNextAvailableColorSet`.
4. Fixed all test mocks to use canonical Activity type with required properties (`id`, `name`, `colorIndex`, `createdAt`, `isActive`).
5. Updated documentation in component docs and README to clarify color derivation and canonical type usage.
6. Ran type-check, lint, and build to confirm all errors resolved.

## Resolution
- All components and tests now use the canonical Activity type.
- Color sets are consistently derived from `colorIndex`.
- Documentation is up to date and accurate.
- Type-check, lint, and build all pass.

## Lessons Learned
- Always centralize type definitions and ensure all code references the canonical source.
- Derive computed properties (like colors) from minimal canonical fields for maintainability.
- Update documentation and tests in parallel with code changes to prevent drift.
- Use automated tools to locate and fix type mismatches across large codebases.
