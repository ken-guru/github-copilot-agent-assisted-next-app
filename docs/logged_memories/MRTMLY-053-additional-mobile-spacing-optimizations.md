### Issue: MRTMLY-053: Additional Mobile Spacing Optimizations
**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Tags:** #css #mobile #responsive-design #spacing-system #optimization
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- After implementing the CSS spacing scale simplification and optimizing the ActivityManager component for mobile
- Other key components (Summary, TimeSetup, Timeline) could benefit from similar mobile spacing optimizations
- These components were still using relatively generous padding on mobile screens
- Mobile layout could be more space-efficient while maintaining visual clarity

#### Implementation Process
1. Analysis of mobile layouts
   - Reviewed all major components on mobile viewports
   - Identified that the Summary, TimeSetup, and Timeline components had excess padding on mobile
   - Determined that padding could be reduced to var(--space-xs) (0.25rem) for better space utilization

2. Implementation approach for Summary component
   - Reduced padding in the mobile media query from var(--padding-sm) to var(--space-xs)
   - Maintained existing spacing between internal elements for readability
   - Preserved the overall visual hierarchy within the component

3. Implementation approach for TimeSetup component
   - Reduced container padding from var(--padding-small) to var(--space-xs) for mobile views
   - Ensured form elements maintained adequate tap targets and spacing
   - Preserved readability of form labels and inputs

4. Implementation approach for Timeline component
   - Added padding of var(--space-xs) for the container on mobile views
   - Reduced the gap between timeline elements to var(--space-xs)
   - Maintained visual connections between timeline entries

5. Verification process
   - Tested all components across various mobile viewport sizes
   - Confirmed layouts maintain proper spacing and alignment
   - Verified that content remains readable and interactive elements are accessible

#### Expected Resolution
- Successfully reduced padding in mobile views for all primary components
- Improved space utilization on smaller screens
- Maintained appropriate visual hierarchy and component relationships
- Consistent mobile experience across the entire application
- All tests passing with the updated spacing

#### Lessons Learned
- Mobile-specific spacing adjustments should be considered early in component design
- A systematic approach to responsive spacing creates a more consistent user experience
- The simplified spacing scale makes it easier to make targeted mobile optimizations
- Small spacing adjustments across multiple components can significantly improve mobile layouts
