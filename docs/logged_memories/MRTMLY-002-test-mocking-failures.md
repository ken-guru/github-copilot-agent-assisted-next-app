### Issue: Test Suite Mocking Failures Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-11-15
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #mocking #jest

#### Initial State
- Multiple test failures across ThemeToggle, SplashScreen, and layout components
- ThemeToggle tests failing due to improper localStorage mocking
- SplashScreen tests failing with LoadingContext undefined error
- Layout tests failing due to missing Geist font module

#### Debug Process
1. ThemeToggle localStorage mocking investigation
   - Original implementation used `localStorage.getItem.mockReturnValue()` but localStorage was not a proper Jest mock
   - Direct mocking of window.localStorage was needed instead of just assuming Jest would automatically mock it
   - classList.contains was not properly tracking dark/light mode state

2. SplashScreen LoadingContext investigation
   - useLoading hook was returning undefined in tests
   - No proper mock was implemented for the LoadingContext
   - Timer-related issues in tests were causing splash screen to remain visible

3. Layout tests Geist font mocking
   - The Geist font modules were not properly mocked in the test environment
   - Tests were trying to access undefined properties (variable)

#### Resolution
1. ThemeToggle test fix:
   - Implemented a complete mock of localStorage with Jest mock functions
   - Added state tracking for dark/light mode
   - Provided proper mock implementations for classList.add, classList.remove, and classList.contains
   - Set up proper mocking for matchMedia

2. SplashScreen test fix:
   - Properly mocked the LoadingContext with Jest.mock
   - Implemented control over the isLoading state for different test scenarios
   - Added jest.useFakeTimers() and proper cleanup with jest.useRealTimers()
   - Added proper mocking for window.getComputedStyle

3. Layout test fix:
   - Created explicit mocks for Geist font modules
   - Ensured the variable properties were correctly defined

#### Lessons Learned
- When mocking browser APIs like localStorage, always use Jest's mock functions explicitly
- Maintain state in mocks when necessary to track changes (like theme state)
- Always use jest.useFakeTimers() and jest.useRealTimers() properly in tests involving timers
- Mock external modules explicitly at the top of test files when they're used by the components under test
- Use Jest's mockImplementation for complex mock behaviors instead of simple return values
