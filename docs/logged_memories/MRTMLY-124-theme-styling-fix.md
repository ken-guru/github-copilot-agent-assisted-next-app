### Issue: Theme Styling Not Working After Routing Fix
**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Tags:** #debugging #styling #themes #css
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- After fixing the 404 page issue, the application's theme styling was broken
- Light and dark mode toggle not working correctly
- Application appeared unstyled with missing theme-related styles
- Multiple conflicting theme implementations causing inconsistency

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of theme implementation mechanisms
   - Discovered multiple conflicting theme implementations:
     - `src/app/globals.css` using CSS variables based on `prefers-color-scheme`
     - `ThemeContext.tsx` setting `data-theme` attribute
     - `ThemeToggle.tsx` adding classes like 'dark-mode' and 'light-mode'
     - `styles/globals.css` using `.dark` class
   - Theme detection in `isDarkMode()` function looked for `dark-mode` class
   - ThemeContext used `data-theme` attribute

2. Analysis of style loading and asset path issues
   - Missing import of `styles/globals.css` in the root layout
   - Inconsistent CSS variable definitions between style files
   - No unified approach to theme implementation

3. Solution design
   - Create a consistent approach to theme detection and application
   - Ensure all CSS files are properly imported
   - Align CSS variable definitions across files

#### Resolution
1. Fixed theme detection mechanism:
   - Updated `isDarkMode()` function to check both class and data-theme attribute
   - Made sure it checks for system preferences but respects user choices

2. Aligned theme application methods:
   - Made ThemeToggle.tsx set both classes and attributes
   - Created helper function in ThemeContext to apply theme consistently
   - Added preload script in layout.tsx to apply theme before render

3. Fixed CSS implementation:
   - Imported styles/globals.css in the root layout
   - Updated app/globals.css to properly handle theme CSS variables
   - Improved CSS variable definitions to correctly apply in both themes
   - Created unified selectors that work with all implementation methods

4. Fixed configuration issues:
   - Fixed the warning about invalid next.config.js options

#### Lessons Learned
- Multiple theme implementation mechanisms can lead to inconsistent styling
- Having a single source of truth for theme state is important
- CSS variables should be defined in one place when possible
- When fixing routing issues, we should ensure all asset paths are still correctly referenced
- Adding a preload script helps prevent "flash of unstyled content" when applying themes
