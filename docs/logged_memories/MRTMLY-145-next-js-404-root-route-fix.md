### Issue: Next.js 404 at Root Route Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-11-01
**Tags:** #debugging #next-js #routing #404 #app-router #deployment
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Tests were passing but browser still showed a 404 page at http://localhost:3000/
- Next.js app router configuration may be incorrect
- Possible incorrect configuration or path resolution issues
- App compiles but doesn't serve the root route properly

#### Debug Process
1. Next.js app router structure investigation
   - Confirmed proper app directory structure in src/app
   - Verified existence of required files (page.tsx, layout.tsx, globals.css)
   - Checked exports of page.tsx and layout.tsx for correct naming
   - Examined file organization based on Next.js 13+ app router requirements

2. Configuration analysis
   - Reviewed next.config.js for potential issues
   - Examined rewrites and redirects that might interfere with root route
   - Checked experimental features like appDir setting
   - Inspected source directory configuration

3. Build and compilation checks
   - Analyzed tsconfig.json for path resolution issues
   - Checked package.json for proper script configuration
   - Verified babel configuration for proper transpilation
   - Reviewed module resolution and import paths

4. Development server configuration
   - Checked for proper development server startup
   - Reviewed environment variables that might affect routing
   - Examined how Next.js resolves the app directory in src
   - Verified port and host configuration

#### Resolution
1. Updated Next.js configuration:
   - Added explicit appDir: true in experimental options
   - Fixed potential rewrite issues that might capture the root route
   - Updated webpack configuration for better compatibility
   - Ensured proper header configuration for static assets

2. Enhanced TypeScript configuration:
   - Verified baseUrl and path mapping in tsconfig.json
   - Ensured proper Next.js type resolution
   - Added incremental compilation support
   - Updated module resolution strategy

3. Fixed build process:
   - Added proper babel configuration
   - Ensured consistent casing in file imports
   - Corrected module resolution paths
   - Updated dist directory configuration

#### Lessons Learned
- Next.js 13+ App Router requires careful directory structure and configuration
- The appDir experimental flag must be explicitly enabled for src/app to work correctly
- Incorrect rewrites or redirects can cause 404 issues at the root route
- Path resolution and import aliases need to be consistent across all configuration files
- TypeScript configuration needs proper baseUrl and paths for @ imports
- The build process needs to correctly resolve the src/app directory
- Testing route configuration should be part of the standard test suite
- When all tests pass but the app still doesn't work, it's often a configuration issue rather than a code issue
