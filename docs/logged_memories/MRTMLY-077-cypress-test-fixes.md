### Issue: Cypress Basic Test Failures Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-06-28
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #cypress #ci-cd
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Cypress tests were integrated into GitHub Actions workflow
- Two tests in `basic.cy.ts` were failing:
  1. Title test expected "Next.js" but found "Mr. Timely"
  2. Navigation test failed to find any `<a>` elements

#### Debug Process
1. Analysis of test expectations vs. actual application
   - Examined the application title: "Mr. Timely" instead of "Next.js"
   - Reviewed the DOM structure and found there might not be `<a>` elements on the homepage

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated the title test to expect "Mr. Timely" instead of "Next.js"
   - Modified the navigation test to check for broader navigation elements (nav, buttons, etc.)
   - Fixed redundant build command in GitHub Actions workflow
   - Added longer timeout for wait-on command to accommodate slower CI environments

#### Resolution
- Modified test expectations to match the actual application behavior
- Created more resilient tests that check for broader page structure
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for better CI performance and reliability
- Set continue-on-error to false to ensure failing tests cause the workflow to fail

#### Lessons Learned
- Always verify actual application behavior before writing test expectations
- Use more flexible selectors when testing page structure
- Avoid duplicate build steps in CI/CD workflows
- Allow sufficient wait time for application startup in CI environments
