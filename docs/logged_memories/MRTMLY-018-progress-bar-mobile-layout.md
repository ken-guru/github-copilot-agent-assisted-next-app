### Issue: MRTMLY-001: Progress Bar Mobile Layout Enhancement
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Tags:** #mobile #layout #progress-bar #optimization #responsive-design
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Progress bar layout looks stretched and inconsistent on mobile devices
- Percentage text overlaps with the progress fill on narrow screens
- Current implementation only considers desktop layout

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated current CSS implementation
   - Found fixed width values in the ProgressBar.module.css
   - Identified lack of media queries for mobile viewports
   - Determined accessibility issues with text contrast on small screens

2. Solution attempts
   - First tried adjusting the existing layout with responsive units
     - Changed px values to percentage and rem units
     - Outcome: Improved but text still overlapped on very small screens
     - Issue: Container was still too wide for mobile viewports

   - Implemented media queries for different viewport sizes
     - Added breakpoints at 480px and 768px
     - Outcome: Progress bar now properly scales but text positioning still problematic
     - Why: Text positioning needed a complete rethink for mobile

   - Redesigned text positioning for mobile view
     - Moved percentage text outside the bar for viewports under 480px
     - Added aria-label for screen readers
     - Outcome: Clean layout on all screen sizes with good accessibility

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented responsive design with:
  - Relative units (rem, %, vh) replacing fixed pixel values
  - Media queries to adjust layout at different breakpoints
  - Text repositioning logic for small screens
  - High contrast maintained across all viewport sizes
- Tests updated to verify responsive behavior using jest-dom

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Always design mobile-first for UI components
  - Use relative units from the beginning to avoid retrofitting
  - Consider text placement carefully for narrow viewports
- Future considerations:
  - Create a shared set of breakpoint variables for consistent responsive design
  - Add automated visual regression tests for different screen sizes
