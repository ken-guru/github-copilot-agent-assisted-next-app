# CodeQL Workflow Improvements

**Date:** 2024-11-11
**Tags:** #security #codeql #workflow #next-js
**Status:** Implemented

## Initial State
- Generic CodeQL configuration with default settings
- Not integrated with the project's build process
- Running analysis for multiple languages including "actions"
- Scanning scheduled at an arbitrary time

## Implementation
1. Focused the analysis on JavaScript/TypeScript only, removing other languages
2. Added Node.js setup and dependency installation steps
3. Integrated with the project's build process
4. Created a custom CodeQL configuration file for Next.js
5. Optimized scanning schedule for weekly runs
6. Added caching for improved performance
7. Added result summary step

## Resolution
The improved CodeQL workflow now:
- Focuses specifically on JavaScript/TypeScript security scanning
- Integrates with the project's build process
- Excludes test files and build artifacts from analysis
- Provides a clear summary of results
- Uses more efficient scheduling

## Lessons Learned
- Security scanning should be tailored to the specific project technology
- Integration with existing build processes provides more accurate analysis
- Custom configuration allows for more precise control over what gets scanned
- Proper exclusions help reduce noise and focus on meaningful security issues
