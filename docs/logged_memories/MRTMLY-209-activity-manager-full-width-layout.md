# MRTMLY-209: Activity Manager Full-Width Layout Fix

**Date:** 2025-06-30  
**Tags:** #layout #bootstrap #ui-improvement #activity-manager  
**Status:** Resolved

## Problem Statement

The ActivityManager component was displaying activities in a multi-column layout (2-3 columns depending on screen size), which reduced the available space for each activity card and made them appear cramped. The requirement was to make each activity take up the full available width instead of being displayed in multiple columns.

### Analysis
- Current implementation used Bootstrap responsive column classes: `xs={12} md={6} lg={4}`
- This created 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablet, 3 columns on desktop
- Activities were cramped and didn't utilize the full available space effectively

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **ActivityManager.tsx Layout Update:**
   - Removed responsive breakpoint classes `md={6}` and `lg={4}`
   - Kept only `xs={12}` to ensure full-width layout on all screen sizes
   - Maintained Bootstrap Row/Col structure for consistent spacing

   ```tsx
   // Before
   <Col 
     key={activity.id} 
     xs={12} 
     md={6} 
     lg={4}
     data-testid={`activity-column-${activity.id}`}
   >

   // After
   <Col 
     key={activity.id} 
     xs={12}
     data-testid={`activity-column-${activity.id}`}
   >
   ```

2. **Test Coverage Updates:**
   - Created comprehensive test suite for full-width layout verification
   - Updated existing Bootstrap tests to match new layout requirements
   - Ensured all responsive behavior tests reflect single-column layout

### Technical Implementation

- **Bootstrap Integration:** Maintained Bootstrap's grid system while using only full-width columns
- **Responsive Design:** Single-column layout works consistently across all screen sizes
- **Accessibility:** No impact on accessibility - all semantic structure preserved
- **Performance:** No performance impact - simply removed unused CSS classes

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience
- Activities now have more space to display information clearly
- Better readability of activity names and status
- More prominent action buttons for better interaction
- Consistent layout across all devices

### Better Visual Hierarchy
- Each activity gets equal visual weight
- Cleaner, more organized appearance
- Better alignment with timeline component layout
- Reduced visual clutter from multiple columns

### Maintenance Benefits
- Simpler responsive logic - no complex breakpoint management
- Easier testing with consistent single-column structure
- Reduced CSS complexity
- Better scalability for varying numbers of activities

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Full-Width Layout Tests:** Verify activities use `col-12` only
- **Bootstrap Integration Tests:** Updated to match new layout
- **Responsive Behavior Tests:** Confirm single-column on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility Tests:** Verify structure remains accessible

### Validation
- All existing functionality preserved
- Bootstrap grid system integrity maintained
- Activity interactions work correctly
- Visual consistency with application design

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/ActivityManager.tsx` - Removed multi-column responsive classes
2. `/src/components/__tests__/ActivityManager.bootstrap.test.tsx` - Updated tests for full-width layout
3. `/__tests__/components/ActivityManager.full-width.test.tsx` - New comprehensive test suite

## Result

Activities now display in a clean, full-width single-column layout that makes better use of available space and provides a more consistent user experience across all device sizes. The change maintains all existing functionality while improving the visual presentation and usability of the activity management interface.
