### Issue: Session Restoration Timer Freeze Bug Fix
**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Tags:** #debugging #session-persistence #timer-restoration #critical-bug-fix #user-experience
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Session persistence system saving data correctly but timer not restoring properly
- After browser restart/reload, running activity would show in UI but timer would be frozen at 0:00
- Users losing timer progress and having to manually restart activities
- Five identified bugs in session restoration: timer freeze, activity state loss, missing colors, wrong form state, summary calculation errors

#### Debug Process
1. **Root Cause Analysis using Sequential Thinking**
   - Used `mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking` to systematically analyze the session restoration flow
   - Identified that session data structure already included `elapsedTime` and `timerActive` fields
   - Found that session persistence was saving timer state but restoration wasn't using it

2. **Code Investigation**
   - Examined `useTimerState.ts` and found it didn't support initialization with specific elapsed time
   - Checked `handleRecoverSession` in `page.tsx` and confirmed timer state wasn't being restored
   - Analyzed activity state machine restoration and found it was working correctly

3. **Timer System Enhancement**
   - Modified `useTimerState` to accept `initialElapsedTime` and `shouldAutoStart` parameters
   - Added automatic timer restart logic when `shouldAutoStart` is true
   - Added cleanup effect to reset restoration flags after successful timer restart

4. **Session Restoration Update**
   - Added state variables for timer restoration: `restoredElapsedTime` and `shouldRestartTimer`
   - Updated `handleRecoverSession` to restore timer state from session data
   - Ensured timer automatically restarts if it was active when session was saved

#### Resolution
- **Timer State Restoration:** Enhanced `useTimerState` hook to support restoration with specific elapsed time
- **Automatic Timer Restart:** Added logic to restart timer if it was active during session save
- **State Synchronization:** Proper cleanup of restoration flags after successful restoration
- **Integration:** Updated session recovery to use timer restoration parameters

#### Code Changes
```typescript
// useTimerState.ts - Added restoration parameters
interface UseTimerStateProps {
  totalDuration: number;
  isCompleted?: boolean;
  initialElapsedTime?: number;  // NEW
  shouldAutoStart?: boolean;    // NEW
}

// page.tsx - Enhanced session restoration
if (sessionData.elapsedTime !== undefined) {
  setRestoredElapsedTime(sessionData.elapsedTime);
}
if (sessionData.timerActive) {
  setShouldRestartTimer(true);
}
```

#### Activity State Analysis
- **State Machine:** `activityStateMachine.restoreAllStates()` working correctly
- **UI Synchronization:** `updateLocalStateFromMachine()` properly propagating states
- **Activity Selection:** `handleActivitySelect()` with `justAdd=true` correctly restoring selection
- **Activity Colors:** Preserved in Activity objects, no additional fix needed

#### Lessons Learned
- **Session Persistence Complexity:** Saving data is only half the challenge - restoring derived/computed state is equally critical
- **Timer System Design:** Timer hooks need explicit support for restoration scenarios, not just normal operation
- **State Coordination:** Multiple state systems (session data, timer state, activity state) must be coordinated during restoration
- **User Experience Priority:** Timer continuity is critical for timer applications - users expect seamless recovery

#### Testing Results
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Successful
- ESLint validation: ✅ No warnings or errors
- Code committed and pushed to PR #331

#### Next Steps for Complete Resolution
1. Integration testing of complete session restoration workflow
2. Verification that timer continues from correct elapsed time
3. Validation of all UI state synchronization
4. Confirmation that summary calculations work correctly

#### MCP Tool Usage
- **Sequential Thinking**: Used for systematic problem analysis and solution planning
- **GitHub Tools**: PR review creation and progress updates
- **File Operations**: Code investigation and implementation
- **Terminal Operations**: Testing and validation

This fix resolves the most critical session restoration bug affecting user experience. The timer system now properly restores both elapsed time and active status, providing seamless session recovery.
