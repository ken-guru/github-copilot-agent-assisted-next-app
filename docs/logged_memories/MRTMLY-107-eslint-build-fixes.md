### Issue: ESLint and TypeScript Errors in Build
**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Tags:** #debugging #eslint #typescript #build #fixes
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build was failing due to multiple ESLint and TypeScript errors
- Issues included:
  - `prefer-const` rule violation in SplashScreen.tsx
  - Require-style imports in test files
  - Use of `any` type in manifest.test.ts
  - Unused variables in serviceWorker.test.tsx
  - Unused variables in utils/colors.ts
  - Missing type annotations in createIcons.ts

#### Debug Process
1. Identified all error locations from build output
   - Examined each file with errors to understand the context
   - Determined which ESLint rules were being violated

2. Fixed the issues systematically:
   - Changed `let` to `const` for variables that were never reassigned
   - Converted require-style imports to ES module imports
   - Created proper TypeScript interfaces to replace `any` types
   - Removed or properly handled unused variables
   - Added type annotations to function parameters
   - Used underscore (_) for intentionally unused catch variables

3. Used convert-test-files.js script to convert JS test files to TS with proper import syntax

#### Resolution
- All ESLint and TypeScript errors were resolved
- Build completed successfully with no code quality issues
- Improved overall code quality and type safety

#### Lessons Learned
- Consistent use of ES module imports improves code quality
- TypeScript type annotations should be added to all functions and variables
- Using underscore (_) for unused error variables is ESLint-compliant
- Converting test files from JS to TS with proper imports helps maintain consistent coding standards
- Always follow ESLint rules to maintain code quality standards
