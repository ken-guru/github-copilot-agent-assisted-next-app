### Feature: Splash Screen Implementation Summary
**Date:** 2023-09-15
**Tags:** #feature #splash-screen #accessibility #performance
**Status:** Completed

#### Initial State
- Application had no visual indication during initial loading
- Users experienced a blank screen until the app was fully initialized
- No branding presence during the critical first moments of user experience

#### Implementation Process
1. Planning phase
   - Created detailed requirements in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
   - Defined technical guidelines and image asset requirements
   - Established validation criteria and expected outcomes

2. Test-first development
   - Created tests for SplashScreen component with various scenarios:
     - Display during loading
     - Hiding when loading completes
     - Respecting minimum display time
     - Accessibility properties
     - Theme compatibility
   - Created tests for LoadingContext to manage application loading state

3. Implementation phase
   - Created LoadingContext for application-wide loading state management
   - Implemented SplashScreen component with:
     - Responsive design for all device sizes
     - Animation effects for visual appeal
     - Accessible markup with proper ARIA attributes
     - Theme compatibility (light/dark mode support)
   - Added CSS module styles with animations and responsive behavior
   - Integrated splash screen into the application entry point

4. Debugging and refinement
   - Fixed test issues related to CSS module class names
   - Resolved timing issues in tests for minimum display time
   - Updated documentation to reflect implementation details
   - Created memory log entries for debugging process

5. Refactoring and optimization
   - Refactored the `useEffect` hook to handle the loading state changes more effectively
   - Removed the `earlyThemeScript` and its injection logic
   - Updated the `isDarkTheme` function to handle theme changes more efficiently

#### Resolution
- Implemented a fully functional, accessible splash screen
- Created a loading state management context for the application
- Ensured proper timing behavior with minimum display time
- All tests passing with good coverage of component behavior
- Documentation completed for both the component and implementation process

#### Lessons Learned
- CSS modules require special handling in tests due to their class name conventions
- Testing timing-based behavior requires careful attention to Jest timer mocking
- Component re-rendering in tests needs explicit control when testing state changes
- Accessibility considerations should be built in from the beginning, not added later
- Minimum display times are important for preventing UI flicker with fast loading

#### Future Improvements
- Consider adding progress indicators for longer loading processes
- Explore branded animation sequences for enhanced visual appeal
- Implement analytics to measure actual load times in production
- Consider skeleton screens as an alternative or complement to splash screens
- Investigate preloading critical assets during splash screen display

#### Note
- Updated the import path for `LoadingContext` to `@/contexts/LoadingContext` to resolve module not found error.
- Added a note about the `getNextAvailableColorSet` function being used in `ActivityManagerCore.tsx`.
- Added a note about the `useLoading` hook return values being explicitly typed.
