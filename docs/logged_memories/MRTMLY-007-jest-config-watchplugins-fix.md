### Issue: Jest Configuration Plugin Error Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-10-30
**Tags:** #debugging #testing #jest #configuration
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Jest test runner failing with error:
```
Error: ‚óè Validation Error:

  Watch plugin jest-watch-typeahead/filename cannot be found. Make sure the watchPlugins configuration option points to an existing node module.
  Configuration Documentation:
  https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration
```
- Jest configuration included watchPlugins that weren't installed in the project
- Tests unable to run due to configuration error
- Specifically `jest-watch-typeahead/filename` and `jest-watch-typeahead/testname` plugins referenced but not installed

#### Debug Process
1. Error analysis
   - Examined error message pointing to missing Jest watch plugins
   - Located offending configuration in jest.config.js
   - Confirmed that the referenced plugins were not installed in the project
   - Verified that these plugins are optional and not required for Jest operation

2. Configuration validation
   - Researched Jest configuration options and their requirements
   - Determined that watchPlugins are only used in watch mode and aren't essential
   - Confirmed that removing the plugins would not affect test execution
   - Created test to verify configuration validity

#### Resolution
- Removed the non-existent watch plugins from Jest configuration:
  ```diff
  - watchPlugins: [
  -   'jest-watch-typeahead/filename',
  -   'jest-watch-typeahead/testname'
  - ],
  ```
- Kept other configuration options intact
- Added test to verify Jest configuration is valid
- Verified tests run successfully after the change

#### Lessons Learned
- Jest configuration should only reference plugins that are actually installed
- Watch plugins in Jest are optional and only used in watch mode
- Always verify dependency requirements when copying configuration from templates or examples
- Testing configuration files themselves can help prevent setup issues
- When seeing "module not found" errors, first check if the module is actually needed
