# Check Icon Horizontal Alignment Fix

**Date:** 2023-12-18
**Tags:** #css #ui #alignment #icons
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Recent fixes to standardize control heights caused a horizontal alignment issue
- The check icon in the completed activity tag was misaligned
- Visual inconsistency in the UI affected the professional appearance of the application

## Implementation Process
1. Analyzed the completedTag CSS structure
   - Found that the new control sizing variables were applied correctly
   - Identified that the issue was with internal content alignment
   - Determined that horizontal alignment needed additional adjustments

2. Applied targeted CSS fixes
   - Added `justify-content: center` to the completedTag to ensure centered content
   - Added specific styling for text content within the tag
   - Applied small position adjustment to the icon using relative positioning
   - Ensured the fix worked consistently across different screen sizes

## Resolution
- The check icon is now properly centered vertically and horizontally
- Text content is consistently spaced from the icon
- Visual appearance is now consistent with other UI elements
- Element sizing remains standardized per previous improvements

## Lessons Learned
- When standardizing component sizes, internal alignment needs careful attention
- Flexbox alone sometimes needs fine-tuning with additional positioning
- Testing on different screen sizes is important for alignment issues
- Maintaining visual consistency requires attention to small details
