### Issue: MRTMLY-008: Service Worker Network-Aware Retry Test Failures
**Date:** 2024-11-25
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #testing #event-listeners
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker network-aware retry implementation failing tests
- Jest tests throwing errors about unhandled promises
- Event listener cleanup not working properly in test environment
- Mock navigator.onLine not behaving as expected

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed test failures
   - Found event listeners not properly cleaned up between tests
   - Identified mocking issues with navigator.onLine
   - Determined Jest environment limitations for service worker testing

2. Solution attempts
   - Improved event listener cleanup
     - Added explicit removeEventListener calls in cleanup functions
     - Outcome: Improved but still occasional failures
     - Issue: Jest environment reset not complete between tests

   - Enhanced test environment setup
     - Created dedicated test environment for service worker tests
     - Implemented better mocking of navigator and window events
     - Outcome: Better but promise rejection errors persisted
     - Why: Async behavior not properly controlled

   - Implemented comprehensive test isolation
     - Added proper async/await and promise handling
     - Created mock service for network events
     - Added explicit test timeouts and cleanup
     - Outcome: Tests now passing consistently

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Dedicated test environment for service worker tests
  - Comprehensive mock for navigator.onLine and related events
  - Proper promise handling for all async operations
  - Complete test isolation with thorough cleanup
- All tests now pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Service worker testing requires specialized test environment
  - Event listeners must be explicitly cleaned up in tests
  - Async behavior needs careful control in test environment
- Future considerations:
  - Create reusable test utilities for service worker testing
  - Consider implementing more integration tests for real-world scenarios
  - Document service worker testing patterns for team reference
