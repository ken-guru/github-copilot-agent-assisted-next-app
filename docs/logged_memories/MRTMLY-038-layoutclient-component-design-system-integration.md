**Tags:** #design-system #layout #mobile-first #accessibility #css-modules
**Status:** Completed

#### Initial State
- LayoutClient component was the main remaining component without design system integration
- Component provided basic structure with inline styles and minimal styling
- Missing responsive design, accessibility features, and design token usage
- Needed proper positioning for service worker update notifications

#### Implementation Process
1. **CSS Module Creation**
   - Created comprehensive `LayoutClient.module.css` with mobile-first approach
   - Implemented responsive design using container queries
   - Added proper z-index management for notifications
   - Included accessibility enhancements (reduced motion, high contrast, focus management)

2. **Component Refactoring**
   - Updated LayoutClient to use new CSS module
   - Added semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA labels
   - Implemented proper positioning for update notifications
   - Added loading state support with aria-busy

3. **Design Token Integration**
   - Added `--z-index-notification: 1055` token to layout.css
   - Used existing spacing, color, and typography tokens throughout
   - Ensured consistent design system integration

4. **Responsive Design Features**
   - Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
   - Container queries for better responsive behavior
   - Safe area insets for mobile device support
   - Dynamic viewport height (100dvh) for mobile browsers

5. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Added proper ARIA roles and labels
   - Implemented focus management
   - Support for reduced motion preferences
   - High contrast mode compatibility
   - Proper semantic HTML structure

#### Resolution
- Successfully integrated LayoutClient with design system
- All tests passing (466/466 tests, 74/74 suites)
- Component now provides proper application-level layout
- Enhanced mobile experience and accessibility compliance
- Consistent styling with rest of application

#### Lessons Learned
- Layout components require special attention to positioning and z-index management
- Container queries provide better responsive behavior than media queries for component-level styles
- Safe area insets are crucial for modern mobile device compatibility
- Performance optimizations (transform: translateZ(0)) help with complex layouts
- Print styles should be considered for application-level components

#### Technical Achievements
- Comprehensive responsive design from 320px to 1536px+
- Proper notification positioning that adapts to screen size
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines
- Performance optimizations for smooth scrolling and rendering
- Print-friendly layout styles
