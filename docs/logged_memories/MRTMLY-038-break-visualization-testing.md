### Issue: MRTMLY-038: Break Visualization Test Suite Expansion
**Date:** 2025-04-03
**Tags:** #testing #breaks #timeline #real-time #edge-cases
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Basic break visualization tests exist but don't adequately test all scenarios
- Known issues with break visualization in the Timeline component
- Need to expand test coverage to capture various break scenarios
- Existing tests don't adequately verify real-time updates and edge cases

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed existing Timeline.breaks.test.tsx
   - Found limited testing of break visualization
   - Identified missing test cases for real-time updates
   - Discovered gaps in multiple break scenario testing
   - Determined need for edge case testing (very short breaks)

2. Designed comprehensive test suite expansion
   - Created tests for immediate break visualization after activity completion
   - Implemented real-time break duration update verification
   - Added tests for multiple break periods
   - Implemented tests for break duration freezing when new activity starts
   - Added edge case test for very short breaks

3. Implementation approach
   - Used Jest's timer mocking (jest.useFakeTimers()) for deterministic testing
   - Applied consistent fixed timestamp (FIXED_TIME) across all tests
   - Utilized act() to properly handle timer updates
   - Created varied test scenarios to cover different break patterns
   - Implemented clear test descriptions for maintainability

#### Next Steps
- Run the expanded test suite to verify it fails with current implementation
- Document specific failure points to guide future implementation
- Implement necessary fixes in the Timeline component
- Verify fixes resolve the identified issues

#### Lessons Learned
- Time-based testing requires careful control of the JavaScript timer
- Break visualization testing needs varied scenarios to be comprehensive
- Real-time updates require special testing approaches with timer manipulation
- Multiple break scenarios are essential to test to ensure proper visualization
- Edge cases like very short breaks need explicit testing
