### Issue: MRTMLY-038: Break Visualization Test Suite Expansion
**Date:** 2025-04-03
**Tags:** #testing #breaks #timeline #real-time #edge-cases
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Basic break visualization tests exist but don't adequately test all scenarios
- Known issues with break visualization in the Timeline component listed in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
- Need to expand test coverage to capture various break scenarios
- Existing tests don't adequately verify real-time updates and edge cases

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed existing Timeline.breaks.test.tsx
   - Found limited testing of break visualization
   - Identified missing test cases for real-time updates
   - Discovered gaps in multiple break scenario testing
   - Determined need for edge case testing (very short breaks)

2. Designed comprehensive test suite expansion
   - Created tests for immediate break visualization after activity completion
   - Implemented real-time break duration update verification
   - Added tests for multiple break periods
   - Implemented tests for break duration freezing when new activity starts
   - Added edge case test for very short breaks

3. Implementation approach
   - Used Jest's timer mocking (jest.useFakeTimers()) for deterministic testing
   - Applied consistent fixed timestamp (FIXED_TIME) across all tests
   - Utilized act() to properly handle timer updates
   - Created varied test scenarios to cover different break patterns
   - Implemented clear test descriptions for maintainability

4. Test execution results
   - Unexpectedly, all tests are passing
   - This suggests either:
     - The tests aren't correctly capturing the bug scenarios described in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
     - The bugs may have been fixed in previous changes without updating the documentation
   - Need to review the implementation to determine if the Break Visualization bugs are truly fixed

#### Next Steps
- Review the Timeline component implementation to understand if and how break visualization issues were addressed
- Compare implementation against the requirements in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
- Determine if there are more specific edge cases or scenarios that need testing
- Consider creating more stringent tests that deliberately stress the system
- Review the MEMORY_LOG.md and IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES.md for any previous fixes that might have resolved these issues

#### Lessons Learned
- Tests passing doesn't always mean the test is properly capturing the bug scenario
- Important to understand the specific bug manifestations before writing tests
- Time-based testing requires careful control of the JavaScript timer
- There may be a discrepancy between documented issues and actual application state
- Documentation needs to be kept in sync with implementation changes
