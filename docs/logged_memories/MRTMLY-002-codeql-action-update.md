**Date:** 2023-06-15
**Tags:** #security #codeql #github-actions #maintenance
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- GitHub workflow was using deprecated CodeQL Action v2
- Received warning: "CodeQL Action major versions v1 and v2 have been deprecated. Please update all occurrences of the CodeQL Action in your workflow files to v3."
- Workflow needed to be updated to use the latest version

#### Debug Process
1. Identified affected files
   - Found that `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` contained references to v2
   - Three actions needed updating: init, autobuild, and analyze

2. Solution implementation
   - Updated all references from v2 to v3
   - Maintained the same workflow structure and configuration

#### Resolution
- Successfully updated all CodeQL Action references to v3
- No other changes to the workflow were required
- GitHub warning should no longer appear when the workflow runs

#### Lessons Learned

- It's important to monitor GitHub notifications about Action deprecations
- Keeping dependencies updated helps prevent security issues and ensures compatibility with latest features
