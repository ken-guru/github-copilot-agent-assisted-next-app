### Issue: MRTMLY-063: Splash Screen Theme Compatibility and Reduced Display Time
**Date:** 2025-04-09
**Tags:** #enhancement #ui #theming #performance #tests
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Splash screen has a hardcoded white background which doesn't respect the system's dark/light mode
- The minimum display time is set to 1500ms (1.5 seconds), which is unnecessarily long
- Requirements:
  1. Make the splash screen respect dark/light mode settings
  2. Reduce the minimum display time to a maximum of 1 second

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of current implementation
   - Examined the SplashScreen component and its CSS
   - Found that the CSS already includes support for dark mode via `:global(.dark)` selectors
   - Current minimum display time is set to 1500ms in the component props

2. Test-first approach implementation
   - Updated existing tests to properly verify dark mode compatibility
   - Added a new test to verify the reduced minimum display time (1000ms or less)
   - Ensured all tests pass with the expected behavior

#### Resolution
- Testing implementation:
  - Enhanced dark mode test by rendering the component in a container with the 'dark-mode' class
  - Added specific test for the new 1000ms minimum display time
  - Added test to verify the component avoids white flash during initial render in dark mode
- Component changes:
  - Reduced default minimumDisplayTime from 1500ms to 1000ms
  - Fixed CSS selectors to use `.dark-mode` instead of `.dark` to match application theme implementation
  - Added immediate theme detection during component initialization to prevent white flash
  - Applied inline styles for immediate theme application before CSS loads
  - Implemented robust error handling with parameter-less catch clauses to satisfy ESLint rules
  - Fixed build errors related to unused variables in catch blocks

#### Lessons Learned
- When enhancing UI components, check if the CSS already supports the desired functionality
- Theme compatibility should be explicitly tested, not just assumed based on CSS selectors
- Setting appropriate timing for UI elements can improve perceived performance
- Use client-side detection of theme preferences to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- Consider inline styles for critical theme elements to ensure they apply immediately
- Always check how themes are actually applied in the application (e.g., CSS class names)
- Be aware of user perception during initial page load and prioritize preventing jarring visual changes
