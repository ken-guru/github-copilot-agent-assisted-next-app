### Issue: MRTMLY-084: SplashScreen Image Aspect Ratio Warning Fix
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Tags:** #debugging #next-image #aspect-ratio #css #splashscreen
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Warning message in the console: "SplashScreen.tsx:139 Image with src "/images/splash/splash-logo.webp" has either width or height modified, but not the other. If you use CSS to change the size of your image, also include the styles 'width: "auto"' or 'height: "auto"' to maintain the aspect ratio."
- The SplashScreen component had an inconsistency between the Next.js Image component props and CSS styling:
  - The Image component had both `width={250}` and `height={250}` explicitly set
  - The CSS was only setting one dimension with `max-width: 250px; height: auto;`
- Additionally, after implementing the fix, a syntax error was discovered in the test file during test execution

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of the warning message
   - Examined the SplashScreen component code and identified the inconsistency between Image component props and CSS styles
   - Discovered that Next.js Image component requires consistent dimension handling to maintain aspect ratio
   - Identified two possible solutions:
     1. Update the CSS to set both dimensions to "auto"
     2. Remove CSS overrides and rely solely on the Image component's explicit dimensions

2. Test-first implementation
   - Created a new test "properly maintains image aspect ratio" to verify proper aspect ratio handling
   - Test validates that if one dimension is modified via CSS, the other dimension is set to 'auto'
   - Initial test execution revealed a syntax error in the test file with a duplicate closing bracket

3. Fix test syntax error
   - Identified a duplicate `});` in the newly added test
   - The syntax error was causing the test suite to fail

#### Resolution
1. CSS Fix for Image Aspect Ratio
   - Added `width: auto;` to complement the existing `height: auto;` in the logo CSS class:
   ```css
   .logo {
     max-width: 250px;
     height: auto;
     width: auto;
     animation: pulseAnimation 2s infinite ease-in-out;
   }
   ```
   - This ensures both dimensions are handled consistently when one is modified

2. Test File Syntax Fix
   - Removed the extra closing bracket `});` that was causing the syntax error
   - Fixed the structure of the test to properly close the test block

#### Lessons Learned
- When styling Next.js Image components with CSS, always ensure consistent handling of both dimensions to maintain aspect ratio
- If modifying one dimension (width or height) with CSS, the other should be set to "auto"
- The Next.js Image component warning system helps identify potential layout shift issues
- When adding new tests, always check for proper syntax and nesting of test blocks to avoid compilation errors
- Test-first development is valuable for validating fixes before implementing them, but syntax errors can still occur
