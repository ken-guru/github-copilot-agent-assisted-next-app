### Issue: MRTMLY-082: Production Console Log Removal
**Date:** 2024-07-15
**Tags:** #debugging #production #optimization #logging
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Production build showing unwanted debug output in the browser console
- Log messages include theme contrast validation messages:
  - "Theme Contrast Validation (Light Mode)"
  - "Main contrast ratio: 16.094069273693023"
  - "Muted contrast ratio: 6.357839536771704"
- These debug messages are useful during development but inappropriate for production
- The logs appear to originate from the theme validation function in the color utilities

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation
   - Traced the console logs to the `validateThemeColors` function in `/src/utils/colors.ts`
   - Found that the function was conditionally handling errors for test environments but not fully preventing logs in production
   - Determined that logs should be completely suppressed in production for better user experience and performance

2. First solution attempt
   - Modified the `validateThemeColors` function to add early return in production environment
   - Added additional checks to ensure console logs only appear in development
   - This approach prevents both the validation work and the logging from occurring in production
   
3. Additional debug message investigation
   - Examined other potential sources of console logs in production
   - Identified direct console.log calls in the service worker
   - Created an environment-aware logging function for the service worker to conditionally show logs

#### Resolution
- Implemented environment-aware logging across the application:
  1. Added early return for `validateThemeColors` in production environment
  2. Created proper unit tests to verify logging behavior in different environments
  3. Added a utility logging function for service worker to conditionally log based on environment
- All unwanted debug messages now suppressed in production builds
- Critical error messages still display when necessary, even in production

#### Lessons Learned
- Debug/logging code should always check for environment before execution
- Production builds should minimize console output for performance and professionalism
- A consistent approach to environment-aware logging is beneficial across the codebase
- Test different environments (development, test, production) to verify appropriate logging behavior
- Consider implementing a centralized logging utility that respects environment settings
