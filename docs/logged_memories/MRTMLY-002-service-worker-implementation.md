### Issue: Service Worker Implementation Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-10-25
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #pwa #offline-support
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker failing to register with console errors:
  - Syntax error: `Cannot use import statement outside a module`
  - Registration failure with 404 errors
  - Incorrect path used during registration: `/undefined/service-worker.js`

#### Debug Process
1. Initial analysis
   - Identified syntax error in service worker file
   - Found incorrect path in registration code
   - Detected missing service worker file in proper location

2. Test-first approach
   - Created tests to verify service worker registration functionality
   - Tested error handling and browser compatibility checks
   - Verified registration success scenarios

3. Implementation
   - Created a custom hook for service worker registration
   - Placed service worker file in the public directory
   - Used standard service worker patterns without ES modules syntax
   - Integrated the registration hook directly into the main page component

#### Resolution
- Created a proper service worker file in the public directory
- Implemented a reusable hook for service worker registration
- Added the hook to the main application component
- Fixed all registration issues and syntax errors
- Added proper error handling for registration failures
- Added browser compatibility check

#### Lessons Learned
- Service worker files must be in the public directory to be accessible at the root path
- ES module syntax requires special handling in service workers
- Registration must happen on the client side
- Testing service worker registration requires mocking browser APIs
- Path to service worker must be absolute from domain root
