# MRTMLY-201: GitHub Actions Workflow and TypeScript Build Fixes

**Date:** 2025-06-18  
**Tags:** #github-actions #typescript #eslint #ci-fix #service-worker #build-errors  
**Status:** Resolved  

## Initial State
- GitHub Actions CI workflow had npm caching enabled, which was previously identified as problematic
- TypeScript build was failing due to ESLint errors in service worker test file
- Multiple `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors in `serviceWorkerRegistration.test.ts`
- One `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` error for unused `mockNavigator` variable
- Build, lint, and Cypress tests were all failing due to these issues

### Build Error Details
```
./src/utils/__tests__/serviceWorkerRegistration.test.ts
12:8  Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
159:11  Error: 'mockNavigator' is assigned a value but never used.  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
171:16  Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
177:16  Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
198:16  Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
199:16  Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
```

## Implementation Process

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes
Removed npm caching from all jobs in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
- `type-check` job: Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node action
- `lint` job: Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node action  
- `test` job: Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node action
- `build` job: Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node action
- `cypress` job: Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node action

This follows the established best practice of using `npm ci` in each job for reliable, reproducible builds.

### 2. TypeScript Fixes in Service Worker Tests
Updated `src/utils/__tests__/serviceWorkerRegistration.test.ts`:

#### Line 12: Fixed fetch mock Response typing
```typescript
// Before (causing error)
} as any);

// After (properly typed)
} as unknown as Response);
```

#### Lines 159-164: Removed unused mockNavigator variable
```typescript
// Before (unused variable)
const mockNavigator = {
  serviceWorker: mockServiceWorkerContainer
};

// After (removed unused variable)
// Direct property assignment without intermediate variable
```

#### Lines 171 & 177: Fixed global object casting
```typescript
// Before (using any)
(global as any).navigator = {
(global as any).window = {

// After (using proper unknown casting)
(global as unknown as { navigator: unknown }).navigator = {
(global as unknown as { window: unknown }).window = {
```

#### Lines 198-199: Fixed cleanup casting
```typescript
// Before (using any)
(global as any).navigator = originalNavigator;
(global as any).window = originalWindow;

// After (using proper unknown casting)
(global as unknown as { navigator: unknown }).navigator = originalNavigator;
(global as unknown as { window: unknown }).window = originalWindow;
```

#### Location object typing
Added proper Location type assertion:
```typescript
location: {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000'
} as Location
```

## Resolution
- **Build**: ✅ Now compiles successfully with `npm run build`
- **Lint**: ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors with `npm run lint`  
- **Tests**: ✅ All service worker registration tests still pass (7/7)
- **CI**: ✅ GitHub Actions workflow uses best practices without npm caching

## Lessons Learned
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Using `unknown` with explicit casting is preferable to `any` for test mocks
2. **Workflow Consistency**: CI configuration can drift - regular validation needed
3. **Type Safety in Tests**: Even test code should maintain type safety standards
4. **Mock Object Typing**: Complex browser APIs require careful typing in test environments
5. **ESLint Integration**: Build-time ESLint checks catch type safety issues early

## Validation Criteria Met
- [x] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] All ESLint errors resolved  
- [x] Service worker tests continue to pass
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow follows best practices
- [x] No unused variables or improper type assertions
