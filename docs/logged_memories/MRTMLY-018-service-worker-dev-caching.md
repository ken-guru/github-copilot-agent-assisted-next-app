### Issue: MRTMLY-018: Service Worker Development Caching Strategy Enhancement
**Date:** 2025-03-02
**Tags:** #service-worker #caching #development-experience #javascript #json
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- JavaScript and JSON files not refreshing properly during development
- Changes to API responses (JSON) not reflected in application
- Development workflow impaired by aggressive caching
- Need for comprehensive solution beyond CSS-specific fix from MRTMLY-017

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated caching behavior for JS and JSON resources
   - Found JavaScript files using cache-first strategy
   - Identified JSON responses being cached too aggressively
   - Determined need for more granular caching rules

2. Solution attempts
   - Extended CSS solution to JavaScript files
     - Applied network-first strategy to JS in development
     - Outcome: Improved but still issues with API responses
     - Issue: Dynamic routes and API endpoints still using old data

   - Implemented URL pattern matching for dynamic content
     - Created pattern-based cache rules for API endpoints
     - Added cache headers inspection for dynamic content
     - Outcome: Better but developers still experiencing stale data
     - Why: Some third-party responses still cached aggressively

   - Developed comprehensive resource-type aware strategy
     - Created different strategies based on resource type and pattern
     - Implemented request-source checking for cross-origin resources
     - Added developer tools for cache inspection and clearing
     - Created special handling for data endpoints
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all development caching issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Resource-type specific caching strategies
  - Pattern-based URL matching for different cache behaviors
  - Header-aware caching for APIs and dynamic content
  - Development-only debug tools for cache management
  - Comprehensive documentation of caching behavior
- Development workflow now smooth with predictable cache behavior

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Different resource types need different caching strategies
  - API and JSON responses require special cache consideration
  - Development tools are essential for cache debugging
- Future considerations:
  - Implement cache versioning system for easier invalidation
  - Consider adopting Workbox for more sophisticated caching
  - Create visual tools for cache management in development
