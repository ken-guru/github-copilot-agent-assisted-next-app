### Issue: MRTMLY-075: Production Console Log Removal
**Date:** 2024-07-15
**Tags:** #debugging #production #optimization #logging
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Production build showing unwanted debug output in the browser console
- Log messages include theme contrast validation messages:
  - "Theme Contrast Validation (Light Mode)"
  - "Main contrast ratio: 16.094069273693023"
  - "Muted contrast ratio: 6.357839536771704"
- These debug messages are useful during development but inappropriate for production
- The logs appear to originate from the theme validation function in the color utilities

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation
   - Traced the console logs to the `validateThemeColors` function in `/src/utils/colors.ts`
   - Found that the function was conditionally handling errors for test environments but not fully preventing logs in production
   - Determined that logs should be completely suppressed in production for better user experience and performance

2. First solution attempt
   - Modified the `validateThemeColors` function to add early return in production environment
   - Added additional checks to ensure console logs only appear in development
   - This approach prevents both the validation work and the logging from occurring in production
   
3. Additional debug message investigation
   - Examined other potential sources of console logs in production
   - Identified direct console.log calls in the service worker
   - Found multiple service worker lifecycle logs appearing in production:
     - Installation messages ("Service worker installing...", "Cached app shell path: /", etc.)
     - Activation messages ("Service worker activating...", "Service worker activated...")
     - Registration confirmation ("Service worker registered")
   - Determined these logs are helpful during development but unnecessary in production

#### Resolution
- Implemented environment-aware logging across the application:
  1. Added early return for `validateThemeColors` in production environment
  2. Created proper unit tests to verify logging behavior in different environments
  3. Created an environment-aware logging utility function for service worker to conditionally show logs:
     ```javascript
     function log(message, level = 'log') {
       // Always log errors and warnings
       const isImportant = level === 'error' || level === 'warn';
       
       // Only log in development or for important messages
       if (isDevelopment() || isImportant) {
         consolelevel;
       }
     }
     ```
     - Enables clear prefixing of all service worker logs
     - Automatically detects development vs. production environments
     - Ensures critical errors and warnings still appear in production
     - Completely suppresses regular logs in production builds
  4. Replaced all direct console.log calls in service worker with the new logging utility
  5. Ensured critical error messages still display even in production
- All unwanted debug messages now suppressed in production builds
- Service worker operations continue normally but without console output in production

#### Lessons Learned
- Debug/logging code should always check for environment before execution
- Production builds should minimize console output for performance and professionalism
- A consistent approach to environment-aware logging is beneficial across the codebase
- Test different environments (development, test, production) to verify appropriate logging behavior
- Consider implementing a centralized logging utility that respects environment settings
- Service worker debugging logs are essential during development but should be hidden in production
