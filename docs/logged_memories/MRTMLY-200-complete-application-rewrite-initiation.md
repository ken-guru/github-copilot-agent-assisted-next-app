# Complete Application Rewrite: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

**Date:** 2025-06-03
**Tags:** #rewrite #vite #react #tailwind #ground-up #modernization
**Status:** In Progress

## Initial State

Starting the complete ground-up rewrite of the existing Next.js application to React + Vite + Tailwind CSS as specified in the PLANNED_CHANGES.md document. This is NOT a migration or port - it's a complete recreation of functionality using modern patterns.

### Current Application Analysis

From the existing Next.js application, I've identified key features to recreate:

#### Core Components:
- **ActivityManager**: Central activity management with state transitions (pending → running → completed)
- **Summary**: Session statistics and activity breakdown
- **Timer System**: Time tracking and display components
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode with HSL-based color system
- **Dashboard Layout**: Responsive grid-based layout

#### Key Features:
- Interactive activity management (create, select, remove, track)
- Real-time timer display and session tracking
- Visual timeline and progress indicators
- Comprehensive test coverage (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Responsive design with mobile compatibility
- Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Theme persistence and color management

#### Technical Stack (Current):
- Next.js 15.3.3 with React 19
- CSS Modules for styling
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- Custom color management system

## Implementation Plan

Following the 5-phase approach outlined in PLANNED_CHANGES.md:

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Today)
- [x] Document current application analysis
- [ ] Create new Vite + React + TypeScript project structure
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- [ ] Set up Vitest + React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure ESLint/Prettier for React 18
- [ ] Design optimal file structure

### Phase 2: Design System Creation
- [ ] Analyze current visual design patterns
- [ ] Create Tailwind theme configuration
- [ ] Implement CSS custom properties for theming
- [ ] Design utility classes for common patterns

### Phase 3: Foundation Components
- [ ] Write tests for theme system components
- [ ] Implement theme context and management
- [ ] Create base UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- [ ] Build layout system and responsive utilities

### Phase 4: Feature Components
- [ ] Recreate Calculator functionality
- [ ] Build Timer widget with modern hooks
- [ ] Implement Weather widget (if applicable)
- [ ] Create comprehensive Task/Activity Manager

### Phase 5: Integration and Polish
- [ ] Dashboard layout implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility verification
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Technology Decisions

### New Stack:
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fastest builds
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 with JIT mode
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks
- **Development**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict

### File Structure Design:
```
react-vite-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── ui/           # Base components
│   │   ├── widgets/      # Feature components
│   │   └── layout/       # Layout components
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── contexts/         # React contexts
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript types
│   ├── styles/           # Global styles
│   └── __tests__/        # Test files
├── public/               # Static assets
└── docs/                 # Documentation
```

## Debug Process

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Starting with creating a completely new directory structure for the Vite-based application alongside the existing Next.js app for reference.

### Step 2: Package Configuration
Will create a minimal but comprehensive package.json with modern dependencies and development tooling.

### Step 3: Development Workflow
Setting up fast development workflow with:
- Vite HMR for instant feedback
- Tailwind JIT compilation
- Vitest for fast testing
- TypeScript strict mode checking

## Next Steps

1. Create new directory structure for Vite app
2. Initialize package.json with curated dependencies
3. Configure Vite with React + TypeScript
4. Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
5. Configure testing environment
6. Create basic file structure and templates

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Clean project setup with modern tooling
- ✅ Fast development workflow established
- ✅ Testing framework operational
- ✅ Theme system foundation ready
- ✅ Component architecture defined

This rewrite represents a complete modernization while preserving all existing functionality and user experience.
