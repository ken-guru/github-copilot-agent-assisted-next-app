### Issue: Viewport Type Definition Error in Build
**Date:** 2025-04-08
**Tags:** #debugging #next-js #typescript #type-error #viewport-configuration #build-error
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Build failing with TypeScript error in src/app/layout.tsx
- Error message: "Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'viewport' does not exist in type 'Viewport'"
- Current implementation had viewport export structured as:
```typescript
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
  themeColor: '#000000',
};
```
- Application runs in development mode but fails during production build

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation of error message
   - TypeScript error indicates we're using an incorrect property structure for the Viewport type
   - Property 'viewport' does not exist in the Viewport type definition
   - Need to consult the Next.js documentation for the correct Viewport type structure

2. Investigating Next.js Viewport type definition
   - Reviewed Next.js 15 documentation for the correct Viewport type structure
   - Found that the type expects direct properties like 'width', 'initialScale', and 'themeColor'
   - Created a test to verify the proper structure before implementation

3. Test implementation
   - Created a test that verifies:
     - Viewport uses correct properties (width, initialScale, themeColor)
     - Viewport does not contain the incorrect 'viewport' property

4. Fix implementation
   - Updated the viewport export in layout.tsx to use the correct property structure
   - Changed from using a nested 'viewport' property to direct properties:
   
   Before:
   ```typescript
   export const viewport: Viewport = {
     viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
     themeColor: '#000000',
   };
   ```
   
   After:
   ```typescript
   export const viewport: Viewport = {
     width: 'device-width',
     initialScale: 1,
     themeColor: '#000000',
   };
   ```

#### Resolution
- Fixed the viewport configuration to match Next.js 15 Viewport type requirements
- Split the 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' string into separate properties
- Tests are now passing successfully
- Production build completes without TypeScript errors

#### Lessons Learned
- Next.js 15 has specific type definitions for Viewport that require direct properties
- The 'viewport' meta tag string format from HTML needs to be split into separate properties
- Always check the TypeScript definitions for Next.js metadata types, as they may not match HTML meta tag formats
- Creating tests first helps verify the correct structure before implementation
- Production builds may catch type errors that development mode doesn't strictly enforce
