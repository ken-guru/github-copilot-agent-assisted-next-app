### Issue: MRTMLY-002: Summary Component Status Message Bug Fix
**Date:** 2024-02-20
**Tags:** #bugfix #testing #ui #state-management
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Summary component displaying incorrect status messages
- Messages not updating when activity state changes
- Inconsistent display between initial render and updates
- Users confused by contradictory status information

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated component render cycle
   - Found status message derived from stale activity state
   - Identified missing dependency in useEffect hook
   - Determined race condition in state updates

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated useEffect dependencies
     - Added missing dependencies to dependency array
     - Outcome: Improved but still occasional stale state
     - Issue: Component structure needed rethinking

   - Refactored state management approach
     - Moved status derivation to custom hook
     - Implemented proper state synchronization
     - Outcome: Better but edge cases still failing
     - Why: Status calculation logic had bugs

   - Comprehensive status logic rewrite
     - Created dedicated status calculation utility
     - Added thorough testing for all activity states
     - Implemented memoization for performance
     - Outcome: Successfully fixed all status display issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Dedicated useActivityStatus hook for status management
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all state transitions
  - Proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Clear status message documentation
- Status messages now consistently accurate across all state changes

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - State derivation should be centralized in custom hooks
  - Effect dependencies must be exhaustive and carefully managed
  - Status calculations need comprehensive testing
- Future considerations:
  - Consider state management library for complex state interactions
  - Implement automated testing for all status transitions
  - Create standard patterns for status message handling
