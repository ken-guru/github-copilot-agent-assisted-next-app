### Issue: MRTMLY-012: Test-Friendly Reset Functionality with Custom Dialog
**Date:** 2025-03-01
**Tags:** #testing #dialog #reset #refactoring
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Reset functionality difficult to test reliably
- Confirmation dialog using browser's native confirm()
- Tests failing intermittently due to dialog interaction
- No way to programmatically control dialog in tests

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated testing limitations
   - Found native confirm() cannot be properly mocked in Jest
   - Identified timing issues with dialog interactions
   - Determined need for custom dialog implementation

2. Solution attempts
   - Attempted to mock window.confirm
     - Used jest.spyOn to replace window.confirm
     - Outcome: Unreliable and browser-dependent
     - Issue: Window object mocking has limitations in test environment

   - Created basic custom confirm component
     - Implemented React-based confirmation dialog
     - Added state management for dialog visibility
     - Outcome: Better but still had test synchronization issues
     - Why: Dialog state changes were asynchronous

   - Implemented comprehensive dialog solution
     - Created ConfirmationDialog component with clear API
     - Implemented synchronous callback pattern
     - Added testID props for reliable test selection
     - Outcome: Successfully testable dialog implementation

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Custom ConfirmationDialog React component
  - Props for title, message, confirm/cancel buttons
  - Callback-based API for confirmation actions
  - Test helper utilities for dialog interaction
  - Comprehensive test coverage
- Reset functionality now fully testable and reliable

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Browser dialogs should be avoided for testable applications
  - Custom dialog components provide better testing control
  - Component design should consider testing needs from the start
- Future considerations:
  - Create a reusable dialog system for all confirmation needs
  - Consider a more comprehensive modal system for the application
  - Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features to dialogs
