### Issue: MRTMLY-031: Test Suite Expansion Planning Based on Known Bugs
**Date:** 2025-04-02
**Tags:** #testing #planning #bugs #test-coverage #regression-testing
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Several known bugs documented in KNOWN_BUGS.md
- Historical issues and fixes recorded in MEMORY_LOG.md
- Current test suite has good coverage but doesn't adequately test edge cases related to known bugs
- Need to expand test coverage before implementing bug fixes

#### Debug Process
1. Analysis of existing test coverage
   - Reviewed all test files in the codebase
   - Identified areas with insufficient coverage for known bugs
   - Found patterns in missing test coverage, particularly around:
     - Activity ordering in Summary component
     - Timer synchronization and updates
     - Break visualization timing in Timeline
     - Idle time calculations
     - Time setup input format handling
     - Service worker functionality
     - Resource cleanup and memory leak prevention

2. Review of documented issues
   - Analyzed KNOWN_BUGS.md to understand current issues
   - Reviewed MEMORY_LOG.md entries related to testing challenges
   - Identified recurring patterns in testing difficulties:
     - Time-dependent component testing
     - State synchronization verification
     - Theme compatibility testing
     - Service worker testing isolation

3. Development of test expansion plan
   - Created a comprehensive plan in PLANNED_CHANGES.md
   - Identified seven key areas for test expansion
   - Organized approach to create isolated tests that specifically target known bugs
   - Established technical guidelines for test implementation

#### Next Steps
- Begin implementing new test files one area at a time
- Start with tests that verify the most critical bugs
- Document each test implementation in the memory log
- Ensure tests initially fail to confirm they capture the bug correctly
- Prepare for bug fixes once test coverage is adequate

#### Lessons Learned
- Test planning should be a deliberate phase before bug fixing
- Patterns in bug reports can reveal gaps in test coverage
- Memory logs provide valuable context for understanding recurring issues
- Comprehensive test coverage is essential for preventing regression
