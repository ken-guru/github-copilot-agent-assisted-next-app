### Issue: MRTMLY-027: Service Worker Update Notification Test Fixes
**Date:** 2025-03-20
**Tags:** #debugging #testing #service-worker #cypress
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker update notification tests failing in Cypress
- Inconsistent notification appearance in test environment
- Update events not properly triggering in tests
- Testing infrastructure not properly simulating update flow

#### Debug Process
1. Analyzed failing Cypress tests
   - Found update notification not appearing consistently
   - Identified service worker registration mocking issues
   - Determined update event simulation problems

2. Solution attempts
   - Improved service worker mocking
     - Created more comprehensive service worker stub
     - Enhanced registration event simulation
     - Outcome: Improved but still flaky tests
     - Issue: Update notification timing inconsistent

   - Addressed timing issues
     - Added explicit wait for notification appearance
     - Implemented reliable update event triggering
     - Outcome: Better but still occasional failures
     - Why: Test environment setup/teardown incomplete

   - Comprehensive test environment refactoring
     - Created dedicated Cypress commands for service worker testing
     - Implemented proper test isolation with complete setup/teardown
     - Added reliable update notification detection
     - Replaced direct DOM queries with test-friendly selectors
     - Outcome: Successfully reliable test suite

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Custom Cypress commands for service worker testing
  - Reliable update event simulation
  - Proper test isolation with complete environment cleanup
  - Test-friendly selectors for notification components
  - Comprehensive documentation for service worker testing
- All Cypress tests now passing consistently

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Service worker testing in Cypress requires specialized commands
  - Test isolation is critical for event-based components
  - Notification timing needs explicit handling in tests
- Future considerations:
  - Create dedicated service worker testing library
  - Implement more comprehensive end-to-end testing patterns
  - Consider adding visual testing for notifications
