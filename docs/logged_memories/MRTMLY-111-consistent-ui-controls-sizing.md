**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Inconsistent sizes across UI controls in the ActivityManager component
- Different heights for buttons and tags
- Alignment issues between controls and tags
- Particularly, the remove-button, completed tag, running indicator, start button, and complete button had different sizes

## Implementation Process
1. Analyzed the current implementation of controls
   - Found inconsistent height declarations
   - Identified issues with padding that affected visual consistency
   - Discovered mixed units (px and rem) causing slight inconsistencies

2. Created standardized control sizing variables in globals.css
   - Added `--control-height-sm`, `--control-height-md`, `--control-height-lg` variables
   - Added icon size variables `--icon-size-sm`, `--icon-size-md`, `--icon-size-lg`
   - Ensured variables follow the established design token pattern

3. Applied consistent sizing to all UI elements
   - Updated the completed tag to use standard height
   - Standardized the remove button dimensions
   - Ensured running indicator matched other control heights
   - Maintained existing button width where appropriate
   - Fixed padding to ensure visual consistency

4. Fixed alignment issues
   - Used flexbox consistently across all controls
   - Ensured all icons are properly centered
   - Applied consistent box-sizing to prevent border inconsistencies
   - Maintained the gap between icon and text in the completed tag

## Resolution
- All UI controls now have consistent heights
- The remove button and completed tag have standardized dimensions
- Start and complete buttons maintain consistent sizing
- Icons are properly aligned in all controls
- Padding and sizing create a visually balanced interface

## Lessons Learned
- Control sizing should be defined at the design system level
- Using consistent height variables creates a more cohesive UI
- Flexbox is the most reliable way to center content in controls
- Box-sizing and padding need careful attention to maintain visual consistency
- Control height should be standardized even when widths differ for functional reasons
