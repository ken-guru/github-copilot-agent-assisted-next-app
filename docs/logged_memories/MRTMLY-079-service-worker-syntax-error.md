### Issue: Service Worker Registration Failed Due to Syntax Error
**Date:** 2025-04-12
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #syntax-error #browser-errors
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Service worker registration was failing in the browser with error:
  ```
  service-worker.js:70 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')' (at service-worker.js:70:31)
  serviceWorkerRegistration.ts:107 Service worker registration failed: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('http://localhost:3000/') with script ('http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js'): ServiceWorker script evaluation failed
  ```
- CSS changes were not being reflected in the browser
- Previous changes to service worker introduced a syntax error

#### Debug Process
1. Test creation for service worker syntax validation
   - Created a test that validates JavaScript syntax in the service worker file
   - Used Node.js vm module to execute the script in a controlled environment
   - Set up mocks for ServiceWorker global objects
   - Verified the script execution would throw an error if syntax was invalid

2. Code analysis of service worker file
   - Identified line 70 as the location of the syntax error
   - Found issue with the CSS detection function implementation
   - Discovered parentheses mismatch in the enhanced CSS detection logic
   - Simplified the implementation while maintaining functionality

3. Implementation of corrected CSS file detection
   - Restructured the CSS detection function for better readability
   - Maintained functionality to detect both regular CSS and CSS modules
   - Added support for Next.js specific CSS chunks
   - Included content-type based detection for CSS-in-JS solutions

#### Resolution
- Fixed syntax error in the `isCssRequest` function implementation
- Simplified the function structure while enhancing its detection capabilities
- Added comprehensive CSS file pattern detection including:
  - Standard CSS files (.css extension)
  - CSS modules (includes .module.css)
  - Next.js CSS chunks (/_next/static/chunks/css/)
  - Content-type based CSS detection
- Added a syntax validation test to prevent similar issues in the future

#### Lessons Learned
- Syntax errors in service workers don't show up during build but appear in the browser
- Always verify service worker changes in the browser before committing
- Service worker errors can prevent critical functionality like CSS updates 
- Adding specific tests for syntax validation helps catch issues early
- Structured and simplified functions reduce the risk of syntax errors
- Detailed error handling for service workers is essential for debugging
