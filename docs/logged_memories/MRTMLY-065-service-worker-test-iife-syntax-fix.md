# Service Worker Test IIFE Syntax Fix

**Status:** Resolved  

## Initial State

After implementing a fix for JSON parsing in our service worker test mocks, we encountered a syntax error:

```
x Expected ',', got '('
  ,-[/Users/ken/Workspace/ken-guru/github-copilot-agent-assisted-next-app/test/service-worker/caching-strategies-extended.test.js:59:1]
56 |             }
57 |           }
58 |           return body;
59 |         }());
  :          ^
60 |         
61 |         this.clone = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
62 |           const clone = new Response(this.body, {
  `----
```

The issue was with the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) syntax we used to implement the `json()` method in our Response mock.

## Debug Process

### 1. Syntax Error Analysis

I analyzed the problematic code:

```javascript
this.json = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(() => {
  if (typeof body === 'string') {
    try {
      return JSON.parse(body);
    } catch (e) {
      // If it's not valid JSON, return an empty object
      return {};
    }
  }
  return body;
}());
```

The error occurred because:

1. We were using `mockResolvedValue()` to set up a Promise-resolving mock
2. We passed an IIFE to this method, causing nested function execution
3. The Next.js SWC transpiler couldn't process this particular syntax construct

### 2. Jest Mock API Review

Looking at the Jest documentation, I realized we had mixed two different approaches:

1. Using `mockResolvedValue()` - for setting a simple resolved promise value
2. Using `mockImplementation()` - for implementing complex logic with a function

The correct approach would be to use just one of these methods, not combining them with an IIFE.

## Resolution

I replaced the problematic code with a cleaner implementation using `mockImplementation()`:

```javascript
// Before - problematic code with IIFE
this.json = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(() => {
  if (typeof body === 'string') {
    try {
      return JSON.parse(body);
    } catch (e) {
      // If it's not valid JSON, return an empty object
      return {};
    }
  }
  return body;
}());

// After - cleaner implementation using mockImplementation()
this.json = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
  if (typeof this.body === 'string') {
    try {
      return Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(this.body));
    } catch (e) {
      // If it's not valid JSON, return an empty object
      return Promise.resolve({});
    }
  }
  return Promise.resolve(this.body);
});
```

The key improvements:

1. Used `mockImplementation()` instead of `mockResolvedValue()` with an IIFE
2. Explicitly returned Promises for all code paths
3. Referenced `this.body` instead of the closure variable `body` for better encapsulation
4. Simplified the overall structure and made it more readable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Jest Mock API Usage**: Jest provides different mock functions for different purposes. Using the right one for each situation leads to cleaner code:
   - `mockReturnValue()` - for synchronous return values
   - `mockResolvedValue()` - for simple Promise resolutions
   - `mockImplementation()` - for complex logic requiring a function

2. **IIFE Anti-patterns**: Using IIFEs with Jest mocks creates unnecessarily complex code that can lead to syntax errors and is harder to read.

3. **SWC Transpiler Limitations**: The Next.js SWC transpiler may have stricter syntax requirements than standard JavaScript engines, making it important to use clean, standard patterns.

4. **Closure vs This Context**: When implementing class methods, using `this` context is clearer than relying on closure variables from the constructor scope.

## Future Improvements

1. **Shared Test Utilities**: These mock implementations should be moved to a shared utility file to ensure consistent behavior across tests.

2. **Type-Safe Mocks**: Adding TypeScript definitions for these mocks would help catch these kinds of errors at compile time rather than runtime.

3. **Jest Mock Guidelines**: Creating documentation on recommended Jest mock patterns for our testing environment would help prevent similar issues.

4. **Test Helper Functions**: Creating helper functions for commonly mocked browser APIs would reduce the likelihood of syntax errors.
