### Issue: Service Worker Core Unused Variable Removal
**Date:** 2025-06-02
**Tags:** #debugging #security #code-scanning #service-worker
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- GitHub Code Scanning tool identified an unused local variable issue in `serviceWorkerCore.ts`
- The `checkValidSW` function was defined but never used
- The function contained unused parameters with underscore prefixes (`_config` and `_response`)
- This issue was reported as a security concern as unused code could introduce performance issues and potential bugs

#### Debug Process
1. First investigation step
   - Examined the code to identify all instances of unused variables
   - Discovered that `checkValidSW` function was likely a remnant from an earlier implementation
   - Verified that a similar function `checkValidServiceWorker` was properly implemented and used instead

2. Solution attempts
   - Considered keeping the function but removing the unused parameters
   - Decided instead to remove the entire function since it was not being used anywhere in the codebase
   - Verified that no imports or references to this function existed in other files using grep search

#### Resolution
- Removed the entire `checkValidSW` function from `serviceWorkerCore.ts`
- Ran the service worker tests to ensure the change didn't break any functionality
- All tests passed, confirming the function was not being used

#### Lessons Learned
- Unused code should be removed promptly during refactoring to prevent security alerts
- Code with underscored parameters often indicates temporary or incomplete implementations
- When removing unused code, it's important to verify with tests that no unexpected dependencies exist
- Security scanning tools like GitHub Code Scanning are valuable for identifying potential issues beyond just security vulnerabilities
