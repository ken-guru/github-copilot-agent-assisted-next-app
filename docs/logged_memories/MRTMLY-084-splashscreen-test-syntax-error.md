### Issue: MRTMLY-084: SplashScreen Test Suite Syntax Error
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #syntax-error #jest
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Test suite failure in SplashScreen.test.tsx with error message:
  ```
  x Expression expected
     ,-[/Users/ken/Workspace/ken-guru/github-copilot-agent-assisted-next-app/__tests__/components/splash/SplashScreen.test.tsx:264:1]
   261 |     // Now it should be gone
   262 |     expect(screen.queryByRole('status')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
   263 |   });
   264 | });
       : ^
       `----

  Caused by:
      Syntax Error
  ```
- The error is preventing the SplashScreen tests from running properly
- The file appears to have a syntax error at its closing bracket

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation of the syntax error
   - Error occurs at line 264, the final line of the file
   - Error suggests a mismatch in bracket structure or an unexpected token
   - Examined the entire file structure to identify the specific issue
   - Found that the file ends with two closing brackets, one for the last test case and one for the describe block
   
2. Detailed code analysis
   - Reviewed the test file structure using code fragments
   - Checked the structure of all test cases for proper closing brackets
   - Found potential issue with bracket placement or structure leading to syntax error

#### Resolution (to be implemented)
- Fix the syntax error by properly structuring the test file
- Ensure all brackets are correctly matched and placed
- Validate the solution by running the test suite again
