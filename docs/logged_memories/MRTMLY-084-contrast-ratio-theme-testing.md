### Issue: MRTMLY-016: Contrast Ratio and Theme Testing Improvements
**Date:** 2025-03-04
**Tags:** #accessibility #testing #dark-mode #contrast
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Dark mode implementation lacks sufficient contrast for text elements
- No automated testing for color contrast ratios
- Theme switching sometimes leaves elements with incorrect colors
- Accessibility audit highlighted contrast issues in dark theme

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated contrast ratio requirements
   - Reviewed WCAG 2.1 standards for minimum contrast ratios
   - Found multiple components below minimum 4.5:1 ratio in dark mode
   - Determined need for systematic color theme testing

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated dark theme color palette
     - Adjusted background and text colors for higher contrast
     - Created contrast verification utility
     - Outcome: Improved but still some components failing
     - Issue: Theme transition logic had edge cases

   - Refactored theme implementation
     - Moved from inline styles to CSS variables
     - Centralized theme definitions
     - Outcome: Better consistency but needed testing
     - Why: Manual testing was too time-consuming and error-prone

   - Implemented automated contrast testing
     - Created Jest tests to verify contrast ratios in both themes
     - Used CSS variable evaluation in tests
     - Added snapshot testing for theme-dependent components
     - Outcome: Successfully caught and fixed remaining issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Comprehensive CSS variable-based theming system
  - Automated tests for contrast ratio verification
  - Standardized color palette with accessibility-verified colors
  - Theme transition utility with proper cleanup
- All components now meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast requirements

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Accessibility requirements should be tested systematically
  - Theme implementation should be centralized for consistency
  - Automated testing for visual aspects is possible and valuable
- Future considerations:
  - Expand testing to other accessibility requirements (focus states, etc.)
  - Consider a design system to maintain accessibility standards
  - Create visual regression tests for theme verification
