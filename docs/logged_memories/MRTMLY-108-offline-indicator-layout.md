### Issue: MRTMLY-009: Offline Indicator Layout and Test Optimization
**Date:** 2025-03-01
**Tags:** #layout #testing #accessibility #mobile
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Offline indicator component positioned poorly on mobile devices
- Indicator appearing too small or obscured by other elements
- Tests for offline state behavior inconsistent and flaky
- Accessibility issues for screen readers and keyboard navigation

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated offline indicator implementation
   - Found absolute positioning causing overlap issues
   - Identified inadequate z-index management
   - Determined missing aria attributes for accessibility

2. Solution attempts
   - Adjusted positioning and z-index
     - Moved indicator to fixed position at top of viewport
     - Increased z-index to ensure visibility
     - Outcome: Improved visibility but still accessibility issues
     - Issue: Screen readers not announcing offline state properly

   - Enhanced accessibility implementation
     - Added proper aria-live region for dynamic announcements
     - Implemented contrast enhancements for visibility
     - Outcome: Better accessibility but test flakiness remained
     - Why: Tests not properly simulating online/offline events

   - Comprehensive refactoring with test improvements
     - Reimplemented indicator with proper semantic HTML
     - Created dedicated network status hook with proper event handling
     - Implemented comprehensive test mocking for network status
     - Added proper keyboard focus management
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA attributes
  - High-contrast design with keyboard focus indicators
  - Fixed positioning optimized for all viewport sizes
  - Comprehensive test suite with reliable network status mocking
  - Clear documentation for network status testing patterns
- All tests now passing consistently

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Network status requires dedicated testing infrastructure
  - Offline indicators should use aria-live for proper screen reader announcements
  - Event-based tests need careful isolation and cleanup
- Future considerations:
  - Create standardized approach for status indicators
  - Implement more sophisticated offline experience
  - Consider implementing service worker message handling for offline status
