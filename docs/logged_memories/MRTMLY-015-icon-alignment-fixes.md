# Icon Alignment and Tag Border Radius Fixes

**Date:** 2023-12-17
**Tags:** #css #ui #icons #alignment #design-system
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Icons inside ActivityManager component buttons were misaligned vertically
- The check icon for completed activity tags wasn't properly centered
- The completed task tag was using a fully rounded (pill) border radius, contradicting the desired squircle aesthetic

## Implementation Process
1. Analyzed the CSS for icon-containing elements
   - Found inconsistent display property usage across icons
   - Identified missing vertical alignment properties
   - Discovered the completed tag was using `--radius-badge` (pill shape) instead of a squircle-style radius

2. Fixed icon vertical alignment issues
   - Updated `.checkIcon` to use flexbox alignment
   - Added proper vertical alignment and margin properties
   - Applied consistent sizing across icons

3. Improved button icon centering
   - Changed `.removeButton` to use flexbox for better centering
   - Added `align-items` and `justify-content` for proper alignment
   - Made sure icons have consistent dimensions

4. Updated completed tag to follow squircle aesthetic
   - Changed border radius from `--radius-badge` (pill) to `--radius-md`
   - Ensured consistent padding and alignment
   - Maintained the visual indicator while improving aesthetic consistency

## Resolution
- All icons are now properly centered vertically within their containers
- The cross icon for removing an activity is centered in its button
- The check icon aligns properly with text in the completed tag
- The completed task tag now follows the squircle aesthetic rather than being fully rounded
- Maintained visual hierarchy while ensuring consistency with design system

## Lessons Learned
- Flexbox is often more reliable than other methods for centering icons
- Even small inconsistencies in icon alignment can create visual noise
- Design system tokens should be used appropriately based on the element's purpose
- Sometimes semantic variables (like `--radius-badge`) need to be overridden for specific use cases
- Visual consistency in small UI elements contributes significantly to overall polish
