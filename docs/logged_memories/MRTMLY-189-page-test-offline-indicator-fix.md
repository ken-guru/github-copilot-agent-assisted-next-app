### Issue: OfflineIndicator Test Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-08-17
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #offline-indicator #activity-button
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- In `src/app/__tests__/page.test.tsx`, the test `"should maintain offline indicator positioning across all app states"` was failing
- Error message: `Unable to find an accessible element with the role "button" and name "/complete/i"`
- The test was expecting to find a button with "Complete" text after clicking on a start button

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of the test file and related components
   - Analyzed the test to understand what it was trying to verify
   - Found that after clicking the "start-activity-homework" button, the test was looking for a button labeled "Complete"
   - Examined `ActivityButton.tsx` component to understand how buttons change their state

2. Root cause identification
   - The primary issue was in the test's mocking strategy
   - When clicking the "start-activity-homework" button, the mock for useActivityState wasn't correctly updating the currentActivity state
   - In the actual component, clicking the start button would set the current activity, which would change the button to a complete button
   - However, in the test, this state change wasn't happening because the mock wasn't properly implemented

3. Solution implementation
   - Modified the test to manually update the `mockCurrentActivity` state after clicking the start button
   - Created a proper TypeScript interface for the MockActivity to avoid type errors
   - Re-rendered the component with the updated state using the `rerender` function from React Testing Library
   - Changed the test to look for the "complete-activity-homework" button by data-testid instead of role/name

#### Resolution
- Fixed the test by properly simulating the state change that happens when a user clicks an activity button
- Added proper TypeScript types to the mock implementation to avoid type errors
- Changed the approach to use data-testid for more reliable test targeting rather than relying on button text

#### Lessons Learned
- When mocking hooks that handle state, it's important to make the mocks properly respond to actions in the test
- For complex component interactions, it's sometimes better to manually update the mock state and re-render rather than relying on event handlers to update state
- Using data-testid attributes for test targeting is more reliable than relying on text content or ARIA roles when the text might change based on state
- Understanding the component's state management is crucial for writing effective tests
