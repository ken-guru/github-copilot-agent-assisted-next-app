### SplashScreen Component Design System Integration
**Date:** 2025-06-16
**Tags:** #design-system #splashscreen #accessibility #mobile-first #animation
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- SplashScreen component had no styling, using basic HTML structure
- Component used inline styles and lacked accessibility features
- Missing semantic HTML structure and proper ARIA attributes
- No responsive design or theme support
- Animation was basic with no consideration for reduced motion preferences

#### Design System Implementation
1. **CSS Module Creation**
   - Created `/src/app/_components/splash/SplashScreen.module.css`
   - Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoint-based scaling
   - Full-screen overlay with proper z-index management
   - Gradient background using primary color palette

2. **Component Structure Updates**
   - Added CSS module import and class usage
   - Implemented semantic HTML with proper ARIA roles and labels
   - Added screen reader support with live regions and hidden content
   - Integrated fade-out transition state management

3. **Design Token Enhancements**
   - Added missing primary color tokens (300, 400, 800, 900) to complete palette
   - Ensured dark theme compatibility for all new color references
   - Utilized existing spacing, typography, and layout tokens

4. **Animation and Accessibility**
   - Smooth entrance animations for logo and loading elements
   - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
   - Staggered loading dot animations with accessible timing
   - High contrast mode support

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
   - Responsive logo sizing across different screen sizes
   - Flexible spacing and typography scaling
   - Print media hiding for accessibility

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Full-screen modal overlay** with proper focus management
- **Theme-aware gradient backgrounds** using design system colors
- **Responsive logo container** with drop shadow effects
- **Animated loading indicators** with accessibility considerations
- **Smooth fade transitions** for entrance and exit states
- **Screen reader optimization** with proper ARIA labeling
- **High contrast support** for improved accessibility
- **Print media hiding** for better user experience

#### Resolution
Successfully integrated SplashScreen component with the design system while maintaining all existing functionality. All tests pass (4/4 SplashScreen tests, 466 total tests). Component now provides:

- Consistent visual design aligned with design system
- Improved accessibility and semantic HTML structure
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Smooth animations with motion preferences respected
- Theme compatibility (light/dark)
- Enhanced user experience with professional polish

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Color Token Completeness**: Ensure full color palette is available when implementing gradients and theme variations
2. **Animation Accessibility**: Always include `prefers-reduced-motion` support for inclusive design
3. **Modal Accessibility**: Proper ARIA roles and live regions are essential for screen reader users
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Mobile-first design with responsive scaling provides optimal experience across devices
5. **Theme Integration**: Dark mode support requires careful consideration of color contrast and shadow effects

#### Next Steps
- Continue design system rollout to remaining unstyled components
- Update documentation to reflect SplashScreen completion
- Consider creating component documentation for the enhanced SplashScreen
