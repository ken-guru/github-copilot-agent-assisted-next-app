### Issue: MRTMLY-038: Timeline Tests Failing Due to Missing ThemeProvider
**Date:** 2023-12-02
**Tags:** #testing #theme-system #context #timeline
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Timeline component tests are failing with error "useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider"
- Two test files affected:
  - src/components/__tests__/Timeline.breaks.test.tsx (3 failing tests)
  - src/components/__tests__/Timeline.render.test.tsx (3 failing tests)
- Error indicates Timeline component is using useTheme hook but tests aren't providing ThemeContext

#### Debug Process
1. Root cause analysis
   - Timeline component uses useTheme hook but test files don't wrap component with ThemeProvider
   - Tests are using direct render instead of renderWithTheme utility
   - This issue was exposed after recent theme system unification changes

2. Planned solution approach
   - Update test files to use renderWithTheme utility instead of direct render
   - Ensure all Timeline tests have proper ThemeProvider wrapper
   - Verify that mock theme values are provided consistently
   - Check that theme-dependent UI elements render correctly

#### Expected Resolution
- Modify test files to use renderWithTheme utility
- Add proper theme context setup in test files
- Run tests to verify all Timeline component tests pass
- Ensure no regressions in theme-related functionality
