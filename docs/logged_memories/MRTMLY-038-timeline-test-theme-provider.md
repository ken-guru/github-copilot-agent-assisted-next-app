### Issue: MRTMLY-038: Timeline Tests Failing Due to Missing ThemeProvider
**Date:** 2023-12-02
**Tags:** #testing #theme-system #context #timeline
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Timeline component tests are failing with error "useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider"
- Two test files affected:
  - src/components/__tests__/Timeline.breaks.test.tsx (3 failing tests)
  - src/components/__tests__/Timeline.render.test.tsx (3 failing tests)
- Error indicates Timeline component is using useTheme hook but tests aren't providing ThemeContext

#### Debug Process
1. Root cause analysis
   - Timeline component uses useTheme hook but test files don't wrap component with ThemeProvider
   - Tests are using direct render instead of renderWithTheme utility
   - This issue was exposed after recent theme system unification changes

2. Planned solution approach
   - Update test files to use renderWithTheme utility instead of direct render
   - Ensure all Timeline tests have proper ThemeProvider wrapper
   - Verify that mock theme values are provided consistently
   - Check that theme-dependent UI elements render correctly

#### Resolution
- Updated test files to use renderWithTheme utility
- Fixed Timeline component tests:
  - Timeline.breaks.test.tsx (3 tests fixed)
  - Timeline.render.test.tsx (3 tests fixed)
- Verified all tests pass after changes
- No regressions in theme-related functionality

#### Lessons Learned
- Always use renderWithTheme for components that depend on theme context
- When unifying theme system, check all test files for proper context setup
- Test utilities should be consistently used across all test files
- Theme-dependent components need special testing consideration
