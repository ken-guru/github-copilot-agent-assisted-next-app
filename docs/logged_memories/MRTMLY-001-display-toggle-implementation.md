### Issue: Display Toggle Feature Implementation
**Date:** 2023-11-01
**Tags:** #feature #wakelock #UI #react-contexts
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Users reported that during activities, their device screens would turn off due to inactivity
- This is particularly problematic during workout sessions or when following recipes
- No existing functionality to keep the display on while using the app

#### Implementation Process
1. Research on available APIs
   - Identified the Wake Lock API as the standard solution
   - Confirmed browser support (Chrome, Edge, Firefox with flag, not Safari)
   - Explored fallback options for unsupported browsers

2. Architecture design
   - Created a DisplaySettingsContext for state management
   - Built useWakeLock custom hook to abstract API complexity
   - Designed UI toggle component with accessibility in mind
   - Implemented localStorage persistence for user preferences

3. Testing approach
   - Wrote tests for the context, hook, and UI components
   - Verified that the toggle state persists across page refreshes
   - Confirmed that the wake lock is properly activated and released
   - Tested graceful degradation in unsupported browsers

4. Integration with Activities page
   - Added the toggle component to the activities page
   - Ensured the wake lock is released when navigating away
   - Verified that the feature doesn't interfere with other functionality

#### Resolution
- Successfully implemented the display toggle feature using the Wake Lock API
- Added appropriate UI with feedback for unsupported browsers
- Ensured settings persist across sessions
- Documented the implementation and usage

#### Lessons Learned
- The Wake Lock API is still considered experimental in some browsers
- Need to consider battery implications of keeping display on
- Local storage is a simple but effective way to persist user preferences
- Future enhancements could include a timeout option to limit battery drain
- Consider implementing a fallback using visibility API for browsers without Wake Lock support
