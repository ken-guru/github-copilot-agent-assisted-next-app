### Issue: MRTMLY-047: Unused Variable in Summary Component
**Date:** 2025-04-05
**Tags:** #linting #deployment #summary #compilation-error
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build fails with ESLint error in Summary.tsx: "_index is defined but never used"
- The error is reported on line 321, where we prefix an unused index parameter with underscore
- Despite using the underscore prefix (which is a common convention), ESLint is still flagging it as an unused variable

#### Debug Process
1. Identified the error location
   - The issue is in Summary.tsx, line 321, in the activityTimes.map callback
   - We've already attempted to follow the convention of prefixing unused parameters with underscore
   - However, some ESLint configurations require additional handling

2. Solution approach
   - Option 1: Remove the index parameter completely if it's not needed
   - Option 2: Add ESLint disable comment for this specific line
   - Option 3: Replace _index with _ (just underscore) as it's a common convention for completely ignored parameters
   - Option 4: Configure ESLint to recognize _prefixed variables as intentionally unused

#### Resolution
- Implemented Option 1 by removing the _index parameter since it's not used in the map callback
- This is the cleanest solution as it removes unused code rather than suppressing warnings
- Tests and build process now succeed with no linting errors

#### Lessons Learned
- Even with underscore prefix convention, some ESLint configurations still flag variables as unused
- When a parameter is completely unused, removing it entirely is often cleaner than marking it
- For React's map functions, we can omit the index parameter if it's not needed in the callback body
- This maintains code cleanliness and passes strict linting rules without requiring ESLint configuration changes
