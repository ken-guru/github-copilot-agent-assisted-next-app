### Issue: MRTMLY-020: Timeline Component Memory Leak
**Date:** 2025-03-03
**Tags:** #debugging #memory-leak #jest #timeline #testing
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Timeline component causing memory leaks in application
- Console warnings: "Memory usage increasing"
- Component not properly cleaning up resources
- Performance degradation over time with Timeline visible

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated component memory management
   - Found multiple setInterval calls without cleanup
   - Identified event listeners not being removed
   - Determined state updates occurring after unmounting

2. Solution attempts
   - Added basic cleanup in useEffect
     - Implemented clearInterval in useEffect return function
     - Outcome: Reduced but not eliminated memory leaks
     - Issue: Some intervals created conditionally not being tracked

   - Implemented ref-based interval tracking
     - Created refs to store all interval IDs
     - Added comprehensive cleanup for all intervals
     - Outcome: Better but still memory growth over time
     - Why: Event listeners still not properly cleaned up

   - Comprehensive cleanup implementation
     - Created central resource tracking mechanism
     - Implemented complete event listener cleanup
     - Added checks to prevent updates on unmounted components
     - Created memory usage monitoring in development
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all memory leaks

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Central registry for all intervals and timers
  - Complete event listener cleanup on unmount
  - Safety checks for state updates after unmounting
  - Development-mode memory monitoring
  - Comprehensive test coverage for cleanup scenarios
- Application now maintains stable memory usage over time

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - All resources (intervals, timers, listeners) must be tracked and cleaned up
  - Components with dynamic resource creation need central tracking
  - UseEffect cleanup functions are essential for all resource-creating effects
- Future considerations:
  - Create standard utilities for resource tracking
  - Implement memory profiling in development tools
  - Consider performance monitoring for production
