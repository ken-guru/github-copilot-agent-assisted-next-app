# TypeScript Jest Assertion Errors Fix

**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Tags:** #typescript #testing #jest #debugging #type-definitions  
**Status:** Resolved  

## Initial State

The project's test files were experiencing TypeScript errors during type checking, specifically with Jest assertion methods:

- `Property 'toBe' does not exist on type 'Assertion'`
- `Property 'toEqual' does not exist on type 'Assertion'` (with a suggestion to use 'equal')
- `Property 'toHaveBeenCalled' does not exist on type 'Assertion'`

These errors indicated that TypeScript wasn't properly recognizing Jest's assertion methods because the project was using both Cypress and Jest, causing type conflicts. The errors appeared when running `npm run type-check` or `tsc --noEmit`.

## Debug Process

1. First investigation step
   - Examined the TypeScript error messages pointing to Cypress type definitions
   - Found that TypeScript was using Chai assertions from Cypress instead of Jest's assertion methods
   - Determined we needed to create custom type declarations for Jest expectations

2. Solution attempts
   - Created a custom type definition file (`jest.d.ts`) to declare Jest's assertion methods
   - Added the file to `tsconfig.json` includes
   - First attempt failed because we needed to extend Chai's Assertion interface instead
   - Fixed the extra closing brace in tsconfig.json

## Resolution

The final solution involved:

1. Creating a custom type definition file at `src/types/jest.d.ts` that:
   - Extended the global Chai.Assertion interface to include all Jest matchers
   - Properly declared the global `expect` function and its methods
   - Included DOM-specific matchers from @testing-library/jest-dom

2. Creating a service worker type definition at `src/types/service-worker.d.ts` to handle the MockRequest type error

3. Fixing the tsconfig.json file by:
   - Removing an extra closing brace causing syntax errors
   - Adding proper "types" array including node, jest, testing-library and cypress
   - Including our custom type definition files in the "include" array

This solution properly reconciled the conflicting type systems of Jest and Cypress, allowing both to coexist in the project without TypeScript errors.

## Lessons Learned

- When using multiple testing frameworks (Jest and Cypress), type conflicts can occur since they use different assertion patterns
- Custom type definitions can solve these conflicts by explicitly merging interfaces
- For Jest and Cypress specifically, extending Chai's Assertion interface is necessary as it's the base for Cypress assertions
- Always check for syntax errors in tsconfig.json as they can cause confusing build failures
- Creating separate namespace declarations for test types isolates them properly from the application code
