### Issue: Cypress Video and Screenshot Configuration Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-11-10
**Tags:** #debugging #cypress #github-actions #testing
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- GitHub Actions workflow attempting to upload Cypress videos and screenshots as artifacts
- Warning message: "No files were found with the provided path: cypress/videos. No artifacts will be uploaded."
- Cypress configuration doesn't explicitly enable or configure video recording
- Screenshot and video directory paths not explicitly specified

#### Debug Process
1. First investigation step
   - Examined the Cypress configuration file (cypress.config.ts)
   - Found that video recording is enabled by default but not explicitly configured
   - Analyzed GitHub Actions workflow configuration for artifact uploading paths
   - Identified potential mismatch between default Cypress output paths and workflow expectations

2. Solution attempts
   - Researched Cypress configuration options for video recording and screenshots
   - Found that we need to explicitly enable video recording and specify screenshot settings
   - Considered modifying the GitHub workflow paths, but determined it's better to configure Cypress to match expected paths
   - Decided to add explicit configuration to ensure videos are generated during CI runs

#### Resolution
- Modified cypress.config.ts to explicitly enable video recording
- Added configuration for screenshot behavior
- Set specific paths for videos and screenshots that match GitHub workflow expectations
- Updated video quality settings for CI environment
- Kept the workflow as-is since the conditional check already handles cases when videos might not be created

#### Lessons Learned
- Cypress has default behavior that may need to be explicitly configured for CI environments
- It's important to align Cypress output paths with GitHub Actions artifact collection paths
- Explicit configuration provides more reliable behavior across different environments
- Video recording settings should be adjusted for CI to balance quality vs. file size
- Consider adding trashAssetsBeforeRuns option to clean previous results and avoid confusion
