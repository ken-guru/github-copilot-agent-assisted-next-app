### Issue: Session Restoration Activity UI State Synchronization Bug Fix
**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Tags:** #debugging #session-restoration #ui-state-synchronization #activity-manager #timeline
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
User reported session restoration bug where:
1. Activity shows as running in timeline but "not started" in activity manager
2. Starting the activity again creates duplicate timeline entries  
3. Break is added between duplicate instances
4. Original activity shows gray color instead of correct activity color
5. Only new instance shows correct color

#### Debug Process

1. **Sequential Thinking Analysis**
   - Used mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking to systematically analyze the three-layer state problem:
     - Activity State Machine: Correctly restored RUNNING states
     - React Component State: currentActivity remained null after restoration
     - UI Props: isRunning prop determined by currentActivity comparison

2. **Root Cause Investigation**
   - Found handleActivitySelect function with justAdd=true returns early without setting currentActivity
   - Session restoration called handleActivitySelect(restoredActivity, true) 
   - This properly restored timeline entries but left currentActivity as null
   - ActivityButton receives isRunning={activity.id === currentActivityId} which evaluates to false

3. **Solution Design**
   - Enhanced handleActivitySelect function with third parameter: isRestoration
   - When isRestoration=true, function sets currentActivity without triggering state changes
   - Updated session restoration to call handleActivitySelect(restoredActivity, false, true)

4. **Implementation Steps**
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced function signature
   const handleActivitySelect = useCallback((
     activity: Activity, 
     justAdd: boolean = false,
     isRestoration: boolean = false
   ) => {
   
   // Added restoration logic
   if (isRestoration) {
     setCurrentActivity(activity);
     return;
   }
   ```

#### Resolution
- Modified handleActivitySelect in useActivityState.ts to support isRestoration parameter
- Updated session restoration logic in page.tsx to properly set currentActivity
- Maintains existing timer restoration functionality while fixing UI state synchronization
- Prevents duplicate timeline entries and ensures correct activity colors

#### Testing Verification
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Build compiles successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Session restoration now properly synchronizes all state layers

#### Lessons Learned
- Session restoration requires careful coordination between multiple state layers
- Activity state machine restoration alone is insufficient for UI synchronization  
- React component state must be explicitly managed during restoration processes
- Test coverage should include UI state verification, not just data restoration
- Sequential thinking approach highly effective for complex multi-layer state problems

#### MCP Tool Usage
- **Sequential Thinking**: Systematic problem breakdown and hypothesis testing
- **File Operations**: Traced data flow through useActivityState.ts, ActivityButton.tsx, ActivityManager.tsx, page.tsx
- **Search Operations**: Located currentActivity state management patterns
- **Terminal Operations**: Verified fix with build and test execution
