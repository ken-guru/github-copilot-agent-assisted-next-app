### Issue: Missing globals.css File Build Error
**Date:** 2023-09-15
**Tags:** #debugging #build #css #deployment
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build process failing with the error:
  ```
  Module not found: Can't resolve '../styles/globals.css'
  ```
- The error occurred in the `pages/_app.tsx` file which was trying to import a non-existent CSS file
- This error prevented the production build from completing

#### Debug Process
1. File structure analysis
   - Examined the project structure to verify the location of style files
   - Confirmed that the `styles/globals.css` file was indeed missing
   - The reference to this file existed in `pages/_app.tsx` but the file itself did not exist

2. Project structure investigation
   - Determined that the application was using a mix of styling approaches
   - Some components were using CSS modules (like the SplashScreen component)
   - The global styles were referenced but not implemented

#### Resolution
- Created the missing `styles/globals.css` file with:
  - CSS variables for theming (light and dark mode)
  - Basic reset styles for HTML elements
  - Utility classes for accessibility and animations
  - Theme color definitions matching those used in component-specific styles
- Maintained the existing import in `_app.tsx` to preserve the current code structure
- Ensured the global styles would complement the component-specific CSS modules

#### Lessons Learned
- Always verify that referenced files exist before deploying
- When implementing new features, ensure all dependent files are created
- CSS organization is critical - mixing global styles and CSS modules requires careful coordination
- CSS variables should be consistent across global styles and component styles
- Running a build before committing changes can catch these types of errors early
