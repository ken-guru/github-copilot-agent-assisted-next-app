### Issue: Missing SplashScreen Component Implementation
**Date:** 2023-11-19
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #component #implementation

#### Initial State
- SplashScreen tests are failing with component not found errors
- Error message: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined"
- Tests are trying to render a SplashScreen component that doesn't exist or isn't properly exported

#### Debug Process
1. Path investigation
   - The test was importing SplashScreen from '../../../components/splash/SplashScreen'
   - But the component wasn't found at this location
   - Checked multiple possible locations but no component implementation existed

2. Test requirements analysis
   - Examined the test file to understand what functionality the component needs:
     - Must support a minimumDisplayTime prop (default: 1000ms)
     - Must check loading state via useLoading hook
     - Must display a logo image that maintains aspect ratio
     - Must include a loading indicator
     - Must have proper accessibility attributes

3. Context requirements
   - The tests mock a LoadingContext with a useLoading hook
   - This context was missing from the project and needed to be implemented

#### Resolution
1. Created SplashScreen component with required functionality:
   - Implemented timer logic to respect minimum display time
   - Added responsive image with proper aspect ratio
   - Included animated loading indicator
   - Added proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - Added dark mode support

2. Created supporting CSS module:
   - Added animations for loading dots and logo
   - Made the splash screen responsive
   - Added proper z-index and positioning

3. Implemented LoadingContext:
   - Created a context provider for app loading state
   - Implemented useLoading hook to access loading state
   - Added proper error handling for hook usage outside provider

4. Updated debugging documentation:
   - Added recommendations to check import paths
   - Added steps to verify component exports
   - Added guidance for module resolution issues

#### Lessons Learned
- Tests can define requirements for components that don't exist yet
- The test-first approach reveals not only functionality requirements but also structural expectations
- Component paths in tests must match the actual project structure
- Context providers need to be properly implemented for component tests
- Missing components should be implemented based on the behavior expected in tests
- Import path errors are often the cause of "component not found" issues
