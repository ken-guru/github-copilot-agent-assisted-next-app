### Issue: MRTMLY-017: Service Worker CSS Caching Strategy Update
**Date:** 2025-03-02
**Tags:** #service-worker #caching #development-experience #CSS
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- CSS changes not reflected immediately during development
- Service worker aggressively caching CSS files
- Developers forced to hard refresh or clear cache frequently
- Poor development experience with style updates

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated service worker caching strategy
   - Found CSS files being cached with stale-while-revalidate
   - Identified no special handling for development environment
   - Determined cache duration too long for development workflow

2. Solution attempts
   - Disabled CSS caching during development
     - Added environment check to skip CSS caching in development
     - Outcome: Improved but developers still experienced cache issues
     - Issue: Environment detection not always reliable

   - Implemented cache busting for CSS
     - Added version parameters to CSS file requests
     - Created build-time generation of cache keys
     - Outcome: Better but introduced build complexity
     - Why: Required additional build steps

   - Created comprehensive environment-aware strategy
     - Implemented different caching strategies based on environment
     - Added network-first strategy for CSS in development
     - Retained efficient caching for production
     - Created override mechanism for developers
     - Outcome: Successfully balanced performance and development experience

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Environment-specific caching strategies
  - Network-first approach for CSS in development
  - Cache-first with validation for production
  - Developer controls for cache behavior
  - Clear documentation for cache strategy
- Significantly improved development experience without sacrificing production performance

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Caching strategies should differ between development and production
  - CSS requires special handling due to frequent changes
  - Developer experience needs equal consideration with performance
- Future considerations:
  - Implement more sophisticated asset versioning system
  - Create development-mode service worker controls
  - Consider implementing hot module replacement for CSS
