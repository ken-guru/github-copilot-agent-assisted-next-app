### Issue: 404 Page Error on Application Load
**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Tags:** #debugging #routing #next-js
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Application showing 404 page when visiting http://localhost:3000
- Tests existing for components but application not rendering correctly
- 404 status code returned when accessing the root URL

#### Debug Process
1. Project structure investigation
   - Found dual directory structure with both `app/` and `src/app/` directories
   - Located two Next.js configuration files (`next.config.js` and `next.config.ts`)
   - Discovered path alias mismatches in the configuration files
   
2. Configuration analysis
   - Identified conflicts between the two Next.js configuration files
   - Path aliases in `next.config.ts` didn't match `tsconfig.json` paths
   - Found that using the Turbopack flag might be contributing to the issue

#### Resolution
1. Consolidated directory structure:
   - Moved `app/service-worker-registration.js` to `src/utils/service-worker-registration.js`
   - Removed the root `app/` directory to avoid confusion with `src/app`
   
2. Fixed configuration:
   - Updated `next.config.js` with explicit App Router configuration
   - Added proper path aliases matching `tsconfig.json`
   - Removed unnecessary `next.config.ts` file
   
3. Started the Next.js server without Turbopack flag:
   - Used `npx next dev` instead of `next dev --turbopack`
   - Application successfully loaded at http://localhost:3000

#### Lessons Learned
- Having multiple Next.js configuration files can cause routing confusion
- Directory structure should be consistent and avoid duplications (like having both `app/` and `src/app/`)
- Path aliases must be consistent between TypeScript and Next.js configurations
- For Next.js App Router projects, it's crucial to have a proper `layout.tsx` and ensure the directory structure follows the App Router conventions
