### Issue: Service Worker Update Error Test TypeScript Errors
**Date:** 2025-04-09
**Tags:** #debugging #typescript #type-error #service-worker #test-failures #jest
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Type checking failing with multiple TypeScript errors in `src/utils/__tests__/serviceWorkerUpdateError.test.ts`
- 14 TypeScript errors found in the test file
- Main issues:
  - Cannot assign to read-only property `process.env.NODE_ENV`
  - Type errors with `window.location` assignment
  - Property overwrites when using spread with `window.location`
  - Missing `__promisify__` property in `setTimeout` mock
  - Invalid type conversion from number to `NodeJS.Timeout`

#### Debug Process
1. Environment variable modification issues
   - Found direct assignments to `process.env.NODE_ENV` which is read-only in TypeScript
   - Identified that standard assignment is not allowed for read-only properties
   - Researched proper methods for mocking environment variables in Jest tests
   - Determined `jest.replaceProperty()` is the correct approach for modifying read-only properties

2. Window location mocking issues
   - Direct assignment to `window.location` not allowed (read-only property)
   - Spread operator causing property overwrite warnings
   - Type mismatch between mock location and expected Location type
   - Missing required properties in the location mock object

3. setTimeout mocking issues
   - Direct mock assignment to `global.setTimeout` causing type errors
   - Return value (numeric ID) not compatible with expected `NodeJS.Timeout` type
   - Missing required `__promisify__` property in the mock implementation

4. Solution implementation
   - Used `jest.replaceProperty()` for environment variables instead of direct assignment
   - Properly typed `originalNodeEnv` to match expected union type
   - Implemented complete location object with all required properties
   - Used `Object.defineProperty()` for window.location mocking
   - Utilized `jest.spyOn()` for setTimeout mocking instead of direct assignment
   - Added proper return type for setTimeout mock (valid Timeout object)

5. Type checking verification
   - Ran `npm run type-check` to verify all type errors are resolved
   - No errors found after implementing the fixes

#### Resolution
- Fixed all TypeScript errors in the service worker update error test
- Used proper Jest mocking techniques for environment variables, window.location and timers
- Maintained the original test functionality while making the code type-safe
- Key improvements:
  - Replaced direct assignments with `jest.replaceProperty()` for read-only properties
  - Used `Object.defineProperty()` for window.location mocking
  - Implemented proper type casting and mocking techniques
  - Added missing properties to mock objects to match expected interfaces
  - Used jest.spyOn() for better typing support with timers

#### Lessons Learned
- Jest mocks need to fully implement the expected interfaces to satisfy TypeScript
- Use `jest.replaceProperty()` for modifying read-only properties
- When mocking browser globals, always check for read-only properties and use appropriate methods
- Save and restore original values in beforeEach/afterEach blocks to avoid test pollution
- Web API objects like Location have complex types that require complete mocking
- Timer functions in Node.js have additional properties like `__promisify__` that need to be mocked
- TypeScript errors in tests are just as important to fix as errors in production code
- Proper typing in tests improves overall code reliability and prevents runtime errors

**Status:** Resolved
