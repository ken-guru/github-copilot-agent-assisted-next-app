### Issue: MRTMLY-218: Planning Template Documentation Integration and Reference Updates
**Date:** 2025-06-18
**Tags:** #documentation #templates #planning #ai-assistance #markdown-links
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- User reported that a planning document template had been added to the project
- Need to verify all markdown links to the template are working correctly
- Documentation needed to be updated to ensure clear usage guidance for both developers and AI agents
- The PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE.md existed but needed better integration across all documentation

#### Debug Process
1. **Analyzed current template integration**
   - Searched for all references to PLANNED_CHANGES_TEMPLATE across the codebase
   - Found template was already well-referenced in:
     - docs/PLANNED_CHANGES.md
     - .github/copilot-instructions.md  
     - README.md
     - docs/README.md
     - docs/templates/README.md
     - docs/components/README.md
   - Verified all template files exist in docs/templates/

2. **Identified areas needing improvement**
   - Copilot instructions needed more explicit guidance for AI agents
   - Template usage guidance could be clearer about mandatory usage
   - Documentation could better emphasize the requirement to use templates
   - Need to ensure consistent messaging across all documents

3. **Updated documentation for clarity**
   - Enhanced .github/copilot-instructions.md with detailed template usage guidelines
   - Added specific "Template Usage for AI Agents" section with mandatory requirements
   - Updated docs/README.md to emphasize planning template requirement
   - Enhanced docs/templates/README.md with stronger guidance for AI agents
   - Ensured all references emphasize mandatory template usage

#### Resolution
Successfully updated all relevant documentation to ensure:
- **Clear mandatory template usage** - All documents now emphasize that the planning template MUST be used for new features
- **AI agent guidance** - Added specific sections explaining template requirements for AI-assisted development
- **Consistent messaging** - All references now use consistent language about template requirements
- **Link verification** - Confirmed all markdown links to templates are working correctly
- **Integration completeness** - Template system is now fully integrated across all project documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Added explicit AI agent template guidelines
- `docs/README.md` - Enhanced AI development notes with template requirements
- `docs/templates/README.md` - Strengthened AI agent guidance with mandatory usage

#### Lessons Learned
- Documentation systems need consistent messaging across all files to be effective
- AI agents benefit from explicit, mandatory language rather than suggestions
- Template compliance should be emphasized as a requirement, not an option
- Regular audits of documentation links and references help maintain system integrity
- Cross-referencing documentation helps ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements
