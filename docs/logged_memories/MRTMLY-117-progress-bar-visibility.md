### Issue: MRTMLY-030: Progress Bar Conditional Visibility Fix
**Date:** 2025-03-27
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #progress-bar #conditional-rendering
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Progress bar occasionally displaying incorrectly
- Visible when it should be hidden and vice versa
- Tests failing intermittently with visibility assertions
- Conditional rendering logic not working as expected

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated conditional rendering implementation
   - Found race condition in visibility state management
   - Identified incorrect dependency array in useEffect hook
   - Determined state updates occurring out of sequence

2. Solution attempts
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies
     - Updated dependency array to include all referenced variables
     - Outcome: Improved but still occasional test failures
     - Issue: Render timing still inconsistent

   - Implemented state batching
     - Used React 18 automatic batching for related state updates
     - Ensured consistent order of operations
     - Outcome: Better but edge cases still failing
     - Why: Testing environment behaving differently than production

   - Comprehensive conditional rendering refactoring
     - Created dedicated visibility management hook
     - Implemented state machine approach for visibility logic
     - Added test-specific render mode for consistent behavior
     - Created deterministic animation handling for tests
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all visibility issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Custom useVisibilityState hook with proper state management
  - Deterministic rendering logic with clear state transitions
  - Test environment detection for consistent behavior
  - Comprehensive test suite for all visibility scenarios
- All tests now passing consistently with proper progress bar visibility

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Conditional rendering needs careful state transition management
  - Test environments require special consideration for timing
  - Animation-related visibility should use state machines
- Future considerations:
  - Create standard pattern for conditional visibility
  - Implement more sophisticated test utilities for animated components
  - Consider server-side rendering implications for visibility state
