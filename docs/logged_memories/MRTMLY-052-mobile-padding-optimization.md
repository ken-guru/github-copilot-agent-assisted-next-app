### Issue: MRTMLY-052: Mobile Padding Optimization
**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Tags:** #css #mobile #responsive-design #spacing-system #optimization
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- After implementing the simplified spacing scale, some mobile views had overly generous padding
- The ActivityManager component specifically had too much padding on mobile screens
- Previously, it was using var(--padding-small) which equates to var(--space-sm) or 0.5rem (8px)
- This caused reduced usable space on smaller screens

#### Implementation Process
1. Analysis of mobile layout
   - Reviewed the ActivityManager component on mobile viewports
   - Determined that the padding could be reduced to improve space utilization
   - Identified that var(--space-xs) (0.25rem/4px) would be more appropriate for mobile views

2. Implementation approach
   - Updated the mobile media query in ActivityManager.module.css
   - Changed padding from var(--padding-small) to var(--space-xs)
   - This provides a more compact layout while still maintaining visual separation

3. Verification process
   - Tested the component across various mobile viewport sizes
   - Confirmed that the layout maintains proper spacing and alignment
   - Verified that content remains readable and interactive elements are accessible
   - Ran tests to ensure no regressions were introduced

#### Resolution
- Successfully reduced padding in mobile views for ActivityManager component
- Updated padding from var(--padding-small) (0.5rem) to var(--space-xs) (0.25rem)
- Improved space utilization on smaller screens
- Maintained appropriate visual hierarchy and component relationships
- All tests passed after the changes
- Lint, build, and type-check verified with no issues

#### Lessons Learned
- Mobile views often benefit from more compact spacing than desktop views
- When refactoring a spacing system, it's important to test across all viewport sizes
- A simplified spacing scale is easier to adjust for responsive design
- It's usually better to be more conservative with spacing on mobile to maximize usable space
- Small spacing adjustments can make significant improvements to mobile UX
