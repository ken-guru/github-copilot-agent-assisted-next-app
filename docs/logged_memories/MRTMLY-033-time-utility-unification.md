### Issue: MRTMLY-033: Time Utility Unification Implementation
**Date:** 2025-03-31
**Tags:** #refactoring #unification #time-utils #code-consolidation #test-first
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- Time-related utility functions are spread across multiple files (`time.ts`, `timeUtils.ts`, and `timelineCalculations.ts`)
- `time.ts` is marked as deprecated and only re-exports from `timeUtils.ts`
- `timeUtils.ts` already contains comprehensive time utilities with good documentation
- `timelineCalculations.ts` contains specialized timeline-related calculations
- Components still import from the deprecated `time.ts` file
- Comprehensive test files exist but are separated

#### Debug Process
1. Initial code analysis
   - Examined all time-related utility files and their functions
   - Analyzed test coverage in existing test files
   - Identified components still referencing the deprecated `time.ts`
   - Found that `timeUtils.ts` already serves as a partially unified utility file

2. Test inventory
   - `time.test.ts` - Tests for `formatTimeHuman` from `time.ts`
   - `timeUtils.test.ts` - Tests for `formatTime` from `timeUtils.ts`
   - `unifiedTimeUtils.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests for all functions in `timeUtils.ts`
   - `timelineCalculations.test.ts` - Tests for timeline-specific calculations

3. Import usage analysis
   - Searched for imports from the deprecated `time.ts` file
   - Found only the `time.test.ts` file still importing from `time.ts`
   - This suggests most components are already using `timeUtils.ts` directly
   - Need to verify all components are using the most appropriate time utility functions

4. Test consolidation strategy
   - `unifiedTimeUtils.test.ts` already provides comprehensive coverage
   - We should ensure this test file covers all edge cases from other test files
   - We should then update component imports as needed
   - Final step will be to potentially mark `time.ts` for removal

5. Test coverage analysis
   - Reviewed the comprehensive `unifiedTimeUtils.test.ts` file
   - Confirmed it already tests all functions from `timeUtils.ts`
   - Verified it covers appropriate edge cases (zero values, negative times, etc.)
   - Found test coverage to be sufficient for our consolidated approach

6. Implementation plan
   - Step 1: Verify `time.ts` is only re-exporting from `timeUtils.ts` (completed)
   - Step 2: Update the test approach to remove dependency on deprecated file
   - Step 3: Make necessary documentation updates to clarify usage
   - Step 4: Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Step 5: Consider deprecation strategy for `time.ts`

7. Implementation progress
   - Updated `time.test.ts` to import directly from `timeUtils.ts` instead of the deprecated `time.ts`
   - Enhanced documentation in `timeUtils.ts` with clear usage guidelines
   - Updated deprecation notice in `time.ts` to be more explicit
   - Ran tests for all time-related utilities, which passed successfully
   
8. Next steps
   - Run a comprehensive type check to ensure no type errors were introduced
   - Consider a strategy for future removal of `time.ts` (document in PLANNED_CHANGES.md)
   - Update project documentation to reference the centralized time utilities

#### Resolution
- Implemented a test-first approach to time utility unification:
  1. Analyzed the existing time utility files and their usage
  2. Discovered that most components were already using `timeUtils.ts` directly
  3. Found that `timeUtils.ts` was already serving as a consolidated time utility file
  4. Made targeted improvements to enhance usability and documentation

- Key changes implemented:
  1. Updated `time.test.ts` to import directly from `timeUtils.ts` instead of the deprecated `time.ts`
  2. Enhanced documentation in `timeUtils.ts` with usage guidelines and clear purpose
  3. Updated the deprecation notice in `time.ts` to be more explicit
  4. Added a formal removal plan for `time.ts` in PLANNED_CHANGES.md

- All tests pass successfully, confirming no regression in functionality
- Type checking passes with no errors

#### Lessons Learned
- Always check for existing consolidation efforts before starting new ones
- Documentation is as important as code for deprecated features
- Test-first approach helped ensure no functionality was broken
- Having a formal removal plan for deprecated files helps future maintainers

**Status:** Resolved
