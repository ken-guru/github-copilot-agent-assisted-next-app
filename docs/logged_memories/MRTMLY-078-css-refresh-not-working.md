### Issue: CSS Changes Not Reflected in Browser Despite Fast Refresh
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Tags:** #debugging #service-worker #css #caching #development-experience
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- CSS changes are being detected and Next.js fast refresh is rebuilding (showing 50ms completed message)
- However, CSS changes are not being reflected in the browser
- Service worker appears to be interfering with the CSS update process
- Console shows the fast refresh is happening but visual updates are not appearing

#### Debug Process
1. Service worker caching investigation
   - Examined the current service worker implementation for CSS handling
   - Found that the service worker was using a more general approach for Next.js assets
   - CSS files were being treated the same as other static assets with potential caching
   - Although the development caching strategy was intended to be network-first, it wasn't specifically enforced for CSS

2. CSS file request path analysis
   - Checked how CSS files are requested and processed during development
   - Discovered that the CSS module files were being processed but the changes weren't reflected
   - The service worker was handling the CSS files but not prioritizing network requests appropriately
   - CSS files needed a more aggressive bypass-cache approach in development

3. Solution design
   - Created a dedicated CSS file detection function to better target CSS resources
   - Added specific handler for CSS files that always prioritizes network in development
   - Increased cache version to ensure old cached CSS was discarded
   - Implemented explicit development environment detection with clear logging
   - Added tests to verify the new CSS handling behavior

#### Resolution
- Implemented a dedicated CSS handling strategy in the service worker:
  - Added `isCssRequest()` function to accurately detect CSS files
  - Created special fetch handler specifically for CSS in development mode
  - Forced network-first strategy with no initial cache checking for CSS
  - Added fallback to cached version only if network request fails
  - Increased cache version from v4 to v5 to ensure fresh caching
  
- Added comprehensive test coverage:
  - Created tests verifying CSS files always use network-first in development
  - Added test to verify cache is bypassed even when cached version exists
  - Ensured the implementation works for both regular CSS and CSS modules

#### Lessons Learned
- Service worker caching strategies need to be tailored for specific file types
- Development experience requires different caching strategies than production
- CSS modules in Next.js need special handling in service workers
- Fast refresh indication doesn't guarantee the browser is showing fresh content
- Cache versioning is important when changing service worker behavior
- Explicit environment detection with clear logging helps troubleshoot issues
- Testing service worker behavior requires mock implementations of browser APIs
