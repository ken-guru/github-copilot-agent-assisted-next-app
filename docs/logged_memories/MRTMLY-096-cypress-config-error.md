### Issue: Invalid Cypress Configuration Property
**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Tags:** #debugging #cypress #configuration #typescript
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build failing with a TypeScript error in `cypress.config.ts`
- Error message: `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'uncaughtExceptionHandler' does not exist in type 'EndToEndConfigOptions'`
- The invalid property was preventing builds and Cypress tests from running

#### Debug Process
1. Investigation of Cypress configuration
   - Identified that `uncaughtExceptionHandler` is not a valid property in Cypress's `EndToEndConfigOptions` type
   - Checked Cypress documentation for the proper way to handle uncaught exceptions
   - Attempted to use `failOnStatusCode`, which was also invalid for this context

2. Research on Cypress event handling
   - Discovered that uncaught exceptions should be handled in the `setupNodeEvents` function
   - Found that Cypress provides an `uncaught:exception` event specifically for this purpose

#### Resolution
1. Removed the invalid property:
   - Removed `uncaughtExceptionHandler: false` from the configuration object

2. Implemented proper exception handling:
   - Added an event handler in `setupNodeEvents` using the `uncaught:exception` event
   - Set up proper logging of uncaught exceptions
   - Configured the handler to return false to prevent Cypress from failing tests

3. Cleaned up configuration:
   - Ensured all properties in the config object are valid according to Cypress types
   - Added comments for better code maintenance
   - Maintained all other valid configuration options

#### Lessons Learned
- Always check TypeScript errors carefully, as they often point to exact property name issues
- Refer to library documentation for proper configuration property names
- For special behaviors like exception handling, look for event-based approaches
- Cypress has specific patterns for handling uncaught exceptions that differ from direct configuration
- When updating third-party tool configurations, check for API changes in newer versions
