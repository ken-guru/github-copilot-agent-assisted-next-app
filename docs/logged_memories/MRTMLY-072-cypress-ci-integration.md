### Implementation: Cypress Tests CI Integration
**Date:** 2023-06-27
**Tags:** #ci-cd #testing #cypress #github-actions
**Status:** Implemented

#### Initial State
- Cypress was set up locally but not integrated into the CI/CD workflow
- Tests were only running manually during development
- The CI workflow had jobs for type-checking, linting, unit tests, and builds

#### Implementation Process
1. Created a basic Cypress test
   - Added a simple test in `cypress/e2e/basic.cy.ts` to verify page loading
   - Test checks basic page functionality and navigation

2. Added Cypress job to GitHub Actions workflow
   - Updated `.github/workflows/main.yml` to include a dedicated Cypress job
   - Configured the job to:
     - Build the application
     - Start a local server
     - Run Cypress tests against it
     - Upload screenshots and videos as artifacts for failed tests

3. Integrated with existing workflow
   - Made the job depend on the install job for efficiency
   - Used the same caching strategy as other jobs
   - Set up proper artifact retention policies

#### Resolution
- Cypress tests now run automatically on every push/PR
- Test artifacts are preserved for debugging purposes
- Integration testing is now part of the CI pipeline alongside unit tests

#### Lessons Learned
- GitHub Actions has excellent integration with Cypress via the cypress-io/github-action
- Using wait-on helps ensure the app is fully started before tests run
- Artifact collection enables easy debugging of test failures in CI
