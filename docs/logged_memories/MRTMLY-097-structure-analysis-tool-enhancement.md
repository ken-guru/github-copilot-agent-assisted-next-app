### Issue: Structure Analysis Tool Enhancement
**Date:** 2024-05-10
**Tags:** #project-structure #tooling #refactoring
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- The project had a basic structure analysis script (analyze-structure.js)
- The script provided limited categorization and reporting capabilities
- There was no way to track changes between runs or verify compliance

#### Enhancement Process
1. Identified key improvement areas
   - Added historical tracking to compare between runs
   - Implemented compliance analysis based on Next.js best practices
   - Improved categorization to better identify components and routes
   - Added file organization analysis by folder and type

2. Implementation approach
   - Added functionality to save snapshots of structure
   - Created comparison capabilities between snapshots
   - Added Next.js compliance checking against best practices
   - Enhanced reporting with specific recommendations

#### Resolution
- Enhanced script now provides:
  - Comprehensive structure analysis with improved categorization
  - Next.js compliance checking with recommendations for improvements
  - Historical tracking to compare structure changes over time
  - Component organization analysis to guide refactoring decisions
  - Better visual reporting with clear recommendations

#### Usage Strategy
1. **Pre-phase Baseline**: Run before starting each restructuring phase
2. **Post-step Verification**: Run after completing major steps
3. **Compliance Checking**: Use recommendations to identify remaining issues
4. **Progress Tracking**: Compare snapshots to document changes
5. **Final Verification**: Run before marking a phase complete

#### Lessons Learned
- Automated analysis tools are valuable for large restructuring projects
- Historical tracking provides tangible metrics of progress
- Compliance checking helps prevent deviation from best practices
- Component organization analysis provides guidance for grouping decisions
