### Issue: MRTMLY-034: Theme System Unification ESLint Errors Blocking Deployment
**Date:** 2025-03-31
**Tags:** #eslint #deployment #vercel #theme-system #unused-variables
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Vercel deployment was failing with multiple ESLint errors
- These errors were primarily related to unused imports and variables
- The build was failing in the theme system unification branch (theme-system-unification)
- Several components had ESLint warnings that were elevated to errors during the build process

#### Debug Process
1. Error identification
   - Examined build logs to identify all ESLint errors
   - Found 10 distinct issues across 9 files
   - Issues included unused imports, unused variables, missing dependencies in useEffect, and missing display name for components

2. Categorized issues
   - Unused imports in test files (rtlRender from @testing-library/react)
   - Unused variable in ThemeToggle component (isDark)
   - Missing dependency in ThemeContext useEffect hook
   - Missing displayName in higher-order component
   - Unused `Theme` import in useTheme hook
   - Unused `error` variable in useTheme try/catch
   - Unused test variables (testRatio in themeColors.test.ts)

#### Resolution
Systematically addressed each ESLint issue:

1. **Summary.tsx**: Removed unused useState import
   ```jsx
   // Changed from
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   // To
   import React from 'react';
   ```

2. **ThemeToggle.tsx**: Fixed unused isDark variable 
   ```jsx
   // Changed from
   const { theme, setTheme, isDark } = useTheme();
   // To
   const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
   ```

3. **ThemeContext.tsx**: Added missing setTheme dependency to useEffect
   ```jsx
   // Changed from
   }, [theme, mounted]);
   // To
   }, [theme, mounted, setTheme]);
   ```

4. **Test files**: Removed unused rtlRender imports in multiple files:
   - ProgressBar.test.tsx
   - Timeline.breaks.test.tsx
   - Timeline.render.test.tsx

5. **renderWithTheme.tsx**: Added displayName to component
   ```jsx
   // Changed from
   return (props: P) => (
     <ThemeProvider>
       <Component {...props} />
     </ThemeProvider>
   );
   // To
   const WithThemeComponent = (props: P) => (
     <ThemeProvider>
       <Component {...props} />
     </ThemeProvider>
   );
   WithThemeComponent.displayName = `WithTheme(${Component.displayName || Component.name || 'Component'})`;
   return WithThemeComponent;
   ```

6. **ThemeContext.test.tsx**: Updated type from `any` to proper typed handler
   ```typescript
   // Changed from
   handler: null as any
   // To
   handler: null as ((event: MediaQueryListEvent) => void) | null
   ```

7. **themeColors.test.ts**: Removed unused testRatio variable in test

After applying all fixes, the Vercel build was able to proceed past ESLint validation.

#### Lessons Learned
- The ESLint configuration in Vercel builds treats warnings as errors, causing deployment failures
- Unused imports and variables in test files are just as critical to fix as those in production code
- React's useEffect dependency arrays should be carefully maintained when refactoring
- Higher-order components need explicit displayName properties for React's DevTools and ESLint validation
- Using "any" types should be avoided in TypeScript projects, even in test files

Future considerations:
- Set up a pre-push git hook to run ESLint with the same settings as the Vercel build
- Consider adding a CI step that mimics Vercel's ESLint configuration to catch these issues earlier
- Implement more thorough pre-commit linting that would catch these issues before pushing to the repository
