# MRTMLY-002: Mobile UI Implementation

**Date:** 2023-07-10
**Tags:** #mobile #UI #responsiveness #implementation
**Status:** In Progress

## Initial State
The current mobile UI had several issues that needed addressing:
1. UI elements were too small and not touch-friendly
2. No indication when the user enters overtime
3. Visual structure had variable nesting of elements affecting clarity

## Implementation Process

### 1. Tests First Approach
Started by writing comprehensive tests for:
- Viewport detection hook
- Mobile UI layout restructuring
- Overtime indicator component
- Responsive sizing and touch handling

This established a clear contract for each component before implementation.

### 2. Viewport Detection Hook
Created a custom `useViewport` hook that:
- Measures screen dimensions on resize
- Categorizes viewport as mobile/tablet/desktop
- Detects touch capabilities using modern APIs
- Updates reactively as the viewport changes

The hook used Media Queries instead of JavaScript touch detection to avoid false positives and better align with browser capabilities.

### 3. Mobile-First Restructuring
Implemented a clear semantic structure with:
- Distinct header, main content, and footer sections
- Consistent spacing and hierarchy
- Touch-friendly interactive elements (minimum 44px)
- Proper padding and margins for mobile use

### 4. Overtime Indicator Component
Created a standalone component that:
- Visibly indicates overtime state
- Shows formatted overtime duration
- Uses animation to draw attention
- Maintains accessibility with ARIA attributes

### 5. CSS Variables Approach
Instead of using direct viewport units:
- Created CSS variables for sizes at the :root level
- Adjusted these based on media queries
- Applied consistent spacing using these variables
- Created touch-friendly modifier classes

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Fade Transitions**: Initially implemented fade transitions were causing layout shifts. Solved by using opacity transitions with fixed positioning.

2. **Touch Detection**: Used pointer media query `(pointer: coarse)` instead of older methods like `'ontouchstart' in window` which can give false positives on some desktop browsers.

3. **Testing Viewport Changes**: Created specialized test utilities to mock viewport resizing and media query matching for reliable tests.

## Final Solution
- Implemented semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA roles
- Created responsive classes using a mobile-first approach
- Added overtime indicator with animation
- Used CSS variables for consistent sizing without direct viewport units
- Created viewport detection hook for responsive behavior

## Lessons Learned

- **Test First Really Works**: By creating tests first, I had clear requirements for each component
- **Media Queries Over Feature Detection**: Modern media queries like `pointer: coarse` are more reliable than older touch detection methods
- **CSS Variables for Scale**: Using variables rather than direct viewport units gives more control and prevents unexpected scaling issues
- **Semantic Structure**: Having a clear semantic hierarchy makes responsive adaptations more predictable

## Next Steps

- Add reduced motion preference detection
- Consider skeleton loaders for slow connections
- Add more touch gestures for common actions
- Improve swipe behaviors for activity management
