### Issue: MRTMLY-050: CSS Spacing Scale Simplification Implementation
**Date:** 2025-04-13
**Tags:** #css #refactoring #spacing-system #variables
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- The application used a complex CSS spacing scale with variables ranging from --space-2xs to --space-3xl
- This created unnecessary complexity for the actual UI needs
- Inconsistent usage of spacing variables across different components
- The globals.css file had already been updated with a simplified 5-point scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)

#### Implementation Process
1. Analysis phase
   - Identified all CSS modules using the old spacing variables
   - Mapped out usage patterns across the codebase
   - Noted areas requiring special attention, particularly --space-sm which changed value from 0.75rem to 0.5rem

2. Implementation phase
   - Applied systematic variable replacements following the mapping:
     - --space-2xs → --space-xs (0.25rem/4px)
     - --space-xs → --space-sm (0.5rem/8px)
     - --space-sm → --space-sm with case-by-case evaluation (0.75rem → 0.5rem)
     - --space-md → --space-md (1rem/16px) - unchanged
     - --space-lg → --space-lg (1.5rem/24px) - unchanged
     - --space-xl → --space-xl (2rem/32px) - unchanged
     - --space-2xl → --space-xl (2.5rem → 2rem)
     - --space-3xl → --space-xl (3rem → 2rem)
   - Updated all component CSS files in the correct order to avoid conflicts
   - Paid special attention to --space-sm values, evaluating each case to determine if --space-sm or --space-md was more appropriate

3. Validation phase
   - Performed visual verification of all components
   - Tested responsiveness across different screen sizes
   - Verified theme compatibility in both light and dark modes
   - Fixed any spacing inconsistencies found during testing

#### Resolution
- Implemented simplified 5-point spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) across all components
- Updated all CSS modules to use the new spacing variables
- Ensured consistent spacing application throughout the UI
- Maintained visual hierarchy and relationships between components
- Documented the new spacing system for future development

#### Lessons Learned
- When creating a design system, it's best to start simple and add complexity only when needed
- Systematic refactoring requires careful planning to avoid unintended consequences
- For variable value changes (like --space-sm), case-by-case evaluation is more effective than bulk replacement
- Visual testing is essential after system-wide CSS changes
- Design systems should be regularly reviewed and simplified when they grow beyond actual needs
