### Issue: MRTMLY-036: Time Utilities Documentation and Maintenance Guidelines
**Date:** 2025-05-10
**Tags:** #documentation #utilities #time-utils #testing #best-practices
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Time utilities consolidation was complete
- Missing comprehensive documentation for time utilities
- No formal process for adding new utility functions
- Inconsistent testing approaches for time-dependent functionality

#### Resolution
- Created comprehensive documentation for time utilities in `/docs/dev-guides/TIME_UTILITIES_GUIDE.md`
- Added detailed testing best practices in `/docs/dev-guides/TIME_UTILITIES_TESTING.md`
- Implemented a review process template for new utility functions
- Documented meta-testing approaches for utility functions

#### Lessons Learned
- Documenting utility functions with examples significantly improves developer experience
- A formal review process prevents duplication and ensures quality
- Testing time-dependent functionality requires specialized approaches
- Meta-testing of test utilities helps maintain testing infrastructure quality

#### Guidelines for Future Utility Development
1. Always check for existing utilities before creating new ones
2. Document thoroughly with JSDoc and examples
3. Follow established naming conventions
4. Handle all edge cases consistently
5. Create comprehensive tests for all functionality
6. Submit proposals for review using the template
