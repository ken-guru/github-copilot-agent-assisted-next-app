### CodeQL Setup Implementation
**Date:** 2023-06-15
**Tags:** #security #codeql #static-analysis #code-quality
**Status:** Completed

#### Initial State
- Project did not have any static code analysis tools configured
- Security vulnerabilities and code quality issues needed automated detection
- No standardized way to detect common Next.js specific issues

#### Implementation Process
1. Created CodeQL configuration
   - Configured to analyze JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Excluded test files and build artifacts
   - Included core application directories

2. Added GitHub workflow
   - Set up automated analysis schedule
   - Configured to run on push and pull requests
   - Applied appropriate permissions

3. Implemented custom queries
   - Focused on Next.js specific concerns (SSR compatibility)
   - Added general security queries (XSS, hardcoded secrets)
   - Added React-specific queries (hooks dependency issues)

4. Created comprehensive documentation
   - Added setup instructions
   - Provided query descriptions
   - Included local testing instructions

#### Results
- Successfully set up automated CodeQL analysis
- Created 4 custom queries for project-specific concerns:
  - XSS vulnerability detection
  - Hardcoded secrets detection
  - SSR compatibility checks
  - React hooks dependency verification
- Added documentation for maintaining and extending the CodeQL setup

#### Lessons Learned
- Custom queries should be focused on project-specific concerns
- Important to exclude test files to avoid false positives
- Documentation is essential for maintaining the CodeQL setup long-term
- Balancing precision and recall in security queries requires ongoing refinement
