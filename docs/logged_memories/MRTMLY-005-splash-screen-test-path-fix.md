### Issue: SplashScreen Test Module Path Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-11-18
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #module-paths #jest

#### Initial State
- One remaining failing test with the SplashScreen component
- Error: `Cannot find module '../../../utils/theme' from '__tests__/components/splash/SplashScreen.test.tsx'`
- The theme utility was created in a different location than what the test expected

#### Debug Process
1. Path analysis
   - Examined the import statement `../../../utils/theme` from `__tests__/components/splash/SplashScreen.test.tsx`
   - Determined this would resolve to `__tests__/utils/theme.ts`
   - But we had implemented the theme utility at `src/utils/theme.ts`
   - Identified the mismatch in module resolution paths

2. Solution options
   - Option 1: Create a duplicate theme utility at `__tests__/utils/theme.ts` (not ideal - duplication)
   - Option 2: Move the existing theme utility (risky - could break other imports)
   - Option 3: Update the import path in the test (simplest, safest solution)

#### Resolution
- Updated the import path in the SplashScreen test
- Changed `../../../utils/theme` to `../../../src/utils/theme`
- This correctly points to the theme utility we created earlier
- The fix is minimal and doesn't require moving files or duplicating code

#### Lessons Learned
- Jest module resolution can be confusing when tests are in a different directory structure than source files
- Watch for relative path differences between test files and implementation files
- When mocking modules in tests, double-check that the mock paths match the actual import paths used by the components
- It's often better to update import paths than to duplicate code or restructure files
- Document module path relationships to avoid similar issues in the future
