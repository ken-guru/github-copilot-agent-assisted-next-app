**Status:** In Progress  

## Initial State

As part of our modular service worker refactoring plan, we've successfully implemented and tested the caching strategies module. The next step is to create tests for the fetch handlers module, which will handle routing of different types of requests to appropriate caching strategies.

Currently, we don't have dedicated tests for the request routing and handling functionality in the service worker. Before implementing the fetch handlers module, we need to create comprehensive tests following our test-first development approach.

## Development Process

### 1. Test Case Identification

I analyzed the typical service worker request handling patterns and identified the following test cases needed for the fetch handlers module:

1. **Routing Tests**:
   - API requests to networkFirst strategy
   - Page navigation requests to networkFirst strategy
   - Static asset requests to cacheFirst strategy
   - Image requests to cacheFirst strategy
   - Font requests to staleWhileRevalidate strategy
   - Unmatched requests to networkOnly strategy

2. **Helper Function Tests**:
   - `isNavigationRequest`: Identifying HTML/page navigation requests
   - `isStaticAsset`: Identifying static assets (JS, CSS, etc.)
   - `isImageRequest`: Identifying image requests
   - `isApiRequest`: Identifying API requests
   - `isFontRequest`: Identifying font requests

3. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Graceful error handling when strategies fail
   - Fallback offline responses for navigation requests

### 2. Testing Environment Setup

Building on our previous work with the caching strategies tests, I set up a comprehensive test environment for fetch handlers:

1. **Mock Browser APIs**: Created mocks for:
   - `Request` with URL, method, and headers support
   - `Response` with status, headers, and body support
   - `Cache` API for storage operations

2. **Mock Caching Strategies**: Created mock implementations of the previously developed caching strategies:
   - `networkFirst`
   - `cacheFirst`
   - `staleWhileRevalidate`
   - `cacheOnly`
   - `networkOnly`

3. **Module Mocking**: Set up Jest module mocking to inject our mock strategies into the module under test

### 3. Test Structure

To ensure comprehensive test coverage, I structured the tests as follows:

1. **Main Handler Tests**:
   - Tests for the primary `handleFetch` function that serves as the entry point for fetch events
   - Verified that different request types are routed to the correct strategies
   - Confirmed error handling and fallback responses work correctly

2. **Helper Function Tests**:
   - Individual tests for each request identification function
   - Multiple test cases per function to cover various URL patterns and edge cases
   - Both positive and negative test cases to ensure correct classification

3. **Error Case Tests**:
   - Tests for scenarios where strategies fail
   - Verification of offline fallbacks for navigation requests

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. URL-Based Routing

The tests are designed around the assumption that the fetch handler module will use URL-based routing to determine the appropriate caching strategy:

```javascript
// Example routing logic structure
if (isApiRequest(request)) {
  return networkFirst(request, CACHE_NAMES.API);
} else if (isNavigationRequest(request)) {
  return networkFirst(request, CACHE_NAMES.PAGES);
} else if (isStaticAsset(request)) {
  return cacheFirst(request, CACHE_NAMES.STATIC);
}
// etc.
```

### 2. Request Classification Approaches

The tests cover multiple approaches to request classification:

1. **URL Pattern Matching**: Using regex or string operations to identify request types
2. **Headers Analysis**: Examining request headers like `Accept` to determine content type
3. **File Extension Matching**: Checking URL file extensions to identify asset types
4. **Path-based Classification**: Using URL path components for classification

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

Tests enforce a robust error handling strategy:

1. All fetch handling should be wrapped in try-catch
2. Navigation requests should get offline fallbacks
3. Failed requests should return appropriate error responses rather than crashing the service worker

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Fetch Handlers Module**: Create the `sw-fetch-handlers.js` file based on the test specifications
2. **Additional Test Edge Cases**: Expand tests to cover more edge cases once the basic implementation is working
3. **Integration Testing**: Develop tests for the integration between the service worker core, fetch handlers, and caching strategies

## Lessons Learned

1. **Request Classification Complexity**: Determining the type of a request can be complex and involve multiple factors (URL, headers, method), requiring sophisticated classification logic.

2. **Strategy Selection Clarity**: Clear rules for which caching strategy to apply to each type of request are essential for predictable offline behavior.

3. **Test First Benefits**: By creating tests first, we've clearly defined the expected behavior of the fetch handlers module before implementation, which will make development more focused.

4. **Mock Reusability**: The browser API mocks developed for the caching strategies tests proved highly reusable for the fetch handlers tests, demonstrating the value of well-designed test utilities.
