### Migration: ProgressBar Component to Bootstrap
**Date:** 2025-06-17
**Tags:** #bootstrap #migration #ui-components #tests
**Status:** Completed

#### Initial State
- The ProgressBar component used custom CSS modules for styling
- It had complex color calculation logic for visual feedback based on progress percentage
- Tests were focused on visual styling and color transitions
- There were two versions of the component in the codebase:
  - `/components/feature/ProgressBar.tsx` (old version with CSS modules)
  - `/src/components/ProgressBar.tsx` (new Bootstrap version)

#### Migration Process
1. Reviewed existing ProgressBar component and its tests
   - Found that the new Bootstrap version was already implemented using `react-bootstrap`'s ProgressBar component
   - Noted that the new component used Bootstrap variants (success, warning, danger) instead of custom color calculations
   - Verified that tests for the new component were already written and passing

2. Checked for imports of the old ProgressBar component
   - Found one reference in `ComponentPropsInterface.test.tsx` still using the old version
   - Updated the import path to use the new Bootstrap version

3. Fixed test issues in `ComponentPropsInterface.test.tsx`
   - Removed the `entries` prop which was only used in the old component
   - Removed the `timerActive` prop which is no longer needed in the Bootstrap version
   - Ran tests to verify the changes were successful

4. Updated project documentation
   - Marked ProgressBar as completed in `docs/PLANNED_CHANGES.md`
   - Created a memory log entry to document the migration process

#### Lessons Learned
1. Component Refactoring Strategy:
   - The new Bootstrap version of the component has a cleaner, simpler implementation
   - Using Bootstrap variants (success, warning, danger) provides semantic meaning and reduces custom color logic
   - The Bootstrap component properly handles accessibility attributes out of the box

2. Testing Approach:
   - Tests for the new component focus more on functional behavior rather than specific visual styling
   - This approach makes tests more resilient to styling changes

3. Component API Simplification:
   - The new component has fewer props (removed `entries` and `timerActive`)
   - This makes the component more focused and easier to use

#### Migration Benefits
1. Simpler code with fewer lines
2. Better accessibility support through Bootstrap
3. Consistent styling across the application
4. More maintainable tests focused on behavior rather than styling
5. Reduced custom CSS and color calculation logic
