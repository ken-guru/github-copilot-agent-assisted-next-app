# Completed Tag Horizontal Alignment Fix

**Date:** 2023-12-17  
**Tags:** #css #ui #alignment #design-system  
**Status:** Resolved

## Initial State
- Previous fix for icon alignment introduced a horizontal alignment issue in the completed tag
- The check icon and text weren't properly spaced horizontally
- The alignment between the icon and text was inconsistent

## Implementation Process
1. Analyzed the horizontal spacing issue
   - Found that mixing margin-right with flexbox properties was causing inconsistent spacing
   - The icon size was slightly too large compared to the text size

2. Applied the following fixes:
   - Added `gap` property to the completed tag for proper horizontal spacing
   - Removed the `margin-right` from the check icon (replaced by gap)
   - Made the check icon slightly smaller (14px instead of 16px) for better proportion with text
   - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to ensure the icon maintains its size

3. Verified the fix maintains vertical alignment
   - Kept the `inline-flex` and `align-items: center` properties for vertical centering
   - Maintained the line-height property for consistent text display

## Resolution
- The completed tag now has proper horizontal spacing between icon and text
- Vertical alignment is maintained
- The icon and text are now properly proportioned
- The squircle aesthetic is maintained with the `--radius-md` variable

## Lessons Learned
- When using flexbox, prefer `gap` over margin for spacing between child elements
- Icon sizing should be proportional to the text size for better visual harmony
- Mixing different spacing methods (margin and flexbox) can lead to alignment issues
- When fixing one alignment issue, consider all axes (both horizontal and vertical)
