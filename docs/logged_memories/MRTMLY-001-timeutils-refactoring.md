### Refactoring: Time Utilities Restructuring
**Date:** 2023-11-12
**Tags:** #refactoring #timeUtils #codeOrganization #bugfix #successful
**Status:** Completed

#### Initial State
- Time utility functions were all in a single file (`/src/utils/timeUtils.ts`)
- The file contained mixed concerns:
  - Time formatting functions
  - Duration calculation utilities
  - Time unit conversion helpers
- Test file was importing directly from timeUtils.ts

#### Implementation Process
1. Created tests for all existing functionality
   - Ensured all functions were properly tested
   - Covered edge cases and special behaviors

2. Created new file structure
   - `/src/utils/time/types.ts` - Shared type definitions
   - `/src/utils/time/timeFormatters.ts` - Time formatting functions
   - `/src/utils/time/timeConversions.ts` - Unit conversion utilities
   - `/src/utils/time/timeDurations.ts` - Duration calculation functions
   - `/src/utils/time/index.ts` - Barrel file for exports

3. Split code by concern
   - Moved `formatTime` and `formatTimeMMSS` to timeFormatters.ts
   - Moved `formatTimeFromMs` to timeConversions.ts
   - Moved `calculateDurationInSeconds` to timeDurations.ts
   - Created proper imports between files

4. Created barrel exports
   - Maintained backward compatibility through re-exports
   - Updated test imports to use the new structure

5. Updated original timeUtils.ts file
   - Converted to re-export all functions from the new structure
   - Added deprecation notice with migration guidance
   - Initially used wildcard re-export which broke named imports

6. Fixed export issue
   - Found that wildcard re-exports weren't properly preserving named imports
   - Updated to explicitly import and re-export each function
   - Maintained both specific named exports and wildcard exports

7. Fixed test utilities
   - Discovered additional test utilities that were not yet refactored
   - Added missing `mockDateNow` and `createTimerMock` functions to `testUtils/timeUtils.ts`
   - Ensured all testing utilities properly imported functions from new structure

8. Fixed timer mock implementation
   - Updated `getRunningTimers()` to return timer count instead of timer objects
   - Fixed `advanceTimers()` to properly handle multiple timers by:
     - Creating a copy of the timers array to prevent modification during iteration
     - Removing timers before calling callbacks to avoid infinite loops
     - Properly checking elapsed time against timer delay

9. Resolved final timer mock issues
   - Implemented a consistent time tracking mechanism in the mock
   - Added proper timer event tracking with an internal "current time" counter
   - Ensured timer callbacks are executed at the correct times when advancing time
   - Fixed delay comparison logic to properly trigger timeouts

10. Verified complete success
    - All 396 tests now pass successfully
    - Functionality is preserved with improved organization
    - Code is now more maintainable with single-responsibility modules

#### Resolution
- Successfully split timeUtils.ts into multiple focused files
- Maintained all functionality and backward compatibility
- Fixed all issues with test utilities
- All tests now pass successfully
- Code organization is now clearer with single-responsibility files

#### Lessons Learned
- Barrel files are effective for maintaining backward compatibility during refactoring
- When refactoring exports, explicitly re-export named imports rather than relying solely on wildcard exports
- Testing immediately after refactoring is crucial to catch issues with module exports
- Organizing by concern improves code readability and maintainability
- Types should be extracted to their own file for better reuse
- Gradual deprecation with clear migration guidance helps with large-scale refactors
- When refactoring utility functions, don't forget to check for specialized test helpers that might depend on them
- When implementing test mocks:
  - Pay close attention to the exact behavior expected by tests
  - Consider edge cases like multiple timers firing at the same time
  - Use a consistent time tracking mechanism when mocking time-based functions
  - Be careful about the order of operations (e.g., removing timers before executing callbacks)
