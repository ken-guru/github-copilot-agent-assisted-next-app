### Issue: MRTMLY-025: Summary Component Theme Color Updates
**Date:** 2025-03-28
**Tags:** #bug-fix #theme #dark-mode #summary #testing
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Summary component displaying incorrect colors in dark mode
- Text contrast issues making content difficult to read
- Activity status indicators using wrong color scheme
- Inconsistent theming between summary and other components

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated theme implementation in Summary component
   - Found hardcoded color values instead of CSS variables
   - Identified incorrect theme context usage
   - Determined missing dark mode styling for several elements

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated color values to use CSS variables
     - Replaced hardcoded colors with theme variables
     - Updated component styles to reference theme
     - Outcome: Improved but still inconsistencies
     - Issue: Status indicators still using wrong colors

   - Fixed status indicator styling
     - Created theme-aware status indicator component
     - Implemented proper color mapping for statuses
     - Outcome: Better but contrast still insufficient
     - Why: Base theme variables needed adjustment

   - Comprehensive theme system overhaul
     - Refactored theme variables for better consistency
     - Implemented semantic color naming for components
     - Created specialized status color system with theme awareness
     - Added contrast verification in component tests
     - Outcome: Successfully resolved all theming issues

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Complete CSS variable implementation for all colors
  - Semantic color system for different component states
  - Status-specific color palette with proper theming
  - Comprehensive contrast testing for all theme combinations
- Summary component now correctly displays in all theme variants

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Component themes should use semantic color variables
  - Status indicators need specialized theme handling
  - Contrast testing is essential for all theme variations
- Future considerations:
  - Create theme token system for more consistent implementation
  - Implement automated contrast checking in the build process
  - Consider adding more theme variations beyond light/dark
