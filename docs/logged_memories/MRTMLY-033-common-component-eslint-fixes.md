# MRTMLY-033: Common Component Library ESLint Fixes

**Date:** 2025-03-31
**Tags:** #eslint #typescript #deployment #common-components
**Status:** Resolved

## Issue Description
During deployment to Vercel, the build process failed due to ESLint errors in newly created common component library files. The errors were preventing successful builds and deployments.

### ESLint Errors

1. **TimeSetup.tsx**
   - Error: 'e' is defined but never used. (@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars)
   - Location: Line 127 in the Button onClick handler

2. **Button.tsx**
   - Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type. (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any)
   - Location: Line 82 in the rest parameter definition

3. **IconButton.tsx**
   - Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type. (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any)
   - Location: Line 61 in the rest parameter definition

4. **Button.test.tsx**
   - Error: 'button' is assigned a value but never used. (@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars)
   - Location: Line 112 in the right-aligned icon test

## Debug Process

1. **Error Analysis**
   - Reviewed the build logs to identify specific error locations and messages
   - Examined each file to understand the context of the issues
   - Found that all issues were related to TypeScript/ESLint rules that were violated during the common component library implementation

2. **TimeSetup.tsx Fix**
   - The Button component had an onClick handler with an unused parameter 'e'
   - Removed the parameter while maintaining the comment that explains form submission is handled by onSubmit
   ```tsx
   // Changed from:
   onClick={(e) => {/* Form submit is handled by onSubmit */}}
   // To:
   onClick={() => {/* Form submit is handled by onSubmit */}}
   ```

3. **Button.tsx and IconButton.tsx Fix**
   - Both components had a rest parameter pattern using `[key: string]: any` which violates the ESLint rule @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
   - Replaced with a more specific type that represents valid HTML button attributes plus our custom React props:
   ```tsx
   // Changed from:
   [key: string]: any;
   // To:
   [key: string]: React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>[keyof React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>] | React.ReactNode;
   ```

4. **Button.test.tsx Fix**
   - Identified an unused variable 'button' in the test for right-aligned icons
   - Removed the unused variable while maintaining the test's functionality

## Verification Steps

1. **Type Checking**
   - Ran `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript typings were valid
   - All type checks passed without errors

2. **ESLint**
   - Ran `npm run lint` to verify all ESLint rules are now satisfied
   - All ESLint checks passed without errors or warnings

3. **Unit Tests**
   - Ran `npm test` to ensure our changes didn't break any existing functionality
   - All 34 test suites with 272 tests passed successfully

## Resolution
All ESLint errors were fixed by:
1. Removing unused variables
2. Providing specific types instead of using 'any'
3. Maintaining the same functionality while adhering to code quality rules

The fixes maintain the original functionality of the components while satisfying the TypeScript and ESLint rules required for successful builds and deployments.

## Lessons Learned

1. **TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Avoid using the 'any' type, especially in component interfaces
   - Use more specific types that accurately represent the expected values
   - For rest parameters in React components, use appropriate HTML attribute types

2. **Unused Variables**
   - Be careful about unused parameters in event handlers
   - For form submission handlers where the event is not used, avoid declaring unused parameters

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Always run linting and type checking before attempting deployment
   - Vercel build process enforces stricter rules than the local development environment
   - Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to catch these issues earlier
