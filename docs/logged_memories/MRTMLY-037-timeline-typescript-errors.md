### Issue: MRTMLY-037: Timeline Component TypeScript Errors
**Date:** 2023-12-02
**Tags:** #typescript #timeline #type-errors #component #exports
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Multiple TypeScript errors found in Timeline component and its imports
- Main issues:
  1. Timeline is being imported as default export but is exported as named export
  2. TimelineProps interface is missing several required properties
  3. Component uses variables that aren't defined in its scope
  4. Property names mismatch between interface and usage (e.g., maxTotalDuration vs totalDuration)

#### Debug Process
1. Import/Export Issues
   - Timeline component is being imported as default in multiple files
   - Component is exported as named export
   - Need to either change imports to named or make Timeline a default export

2. Props Interface Analysis
   - TimelineProps interface is missing several properties used in the component:
     - timelineEntries
     - onEdit
     - onRemove
     - showLinkSlot
     - maxTotalDuration
     - isReadOnly
     - tickInterval

3. Scope Variable Issues
   - Several variables used without being defined:
     - setCurrentElapsedTime
     - initialElapsedTime
     - hasEntries
     - entries
     - timerActive
     - totalDuration
     - currentElapsedTime
     - isTimeUp
     - allActivitiesCompleted

#### Planned Resolution
1. Fix Timeline exports
   - Add default export to Timeline component
   - Update imports in test files and page component

2. Update TimelineProps interface
   - Add all missing properties with correct types
   - Ensure optional properties are marked with '?'
   - Align property names (totalDuration vs maxTotalDuration)

3. Add missing state variables
   - Add useState hooks for missing state variables
   - Define computed properties properly
   - Use props values instead of undefined variables

4. Update component implementation
   - Use props values consistently throughout the component
   - Add proper type annotations
   - Initialize state with prop values

#### Resolution
- Updated TimelineProps interface to include all required properties
- Fixed import/export consistency across all files
- Removed unused props and variables
- All TypeScript errors resolved after changes
- Verified no functionality regressions

#### Lessons Learned
- Keep interface definitions in sync with component implementation
- Consistently use either default or named exports across the codebase
- Remove unused props to prevent confusion and type errors
- Document prop requirements clearly in interfaces
