### Issue: MRTMLY-054: Replacing Remaining Hardcoded Spacing Values
**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Tags:** #css #spacing-system #variables #consistency #refactoring
**Status:** In Progress

#### Initial State
- After implementing the simplified spacing scale and optimizing mobile padding
- Several components still contained hardcoded spacing values (rem/px) for properties like border-radius
- This inconsistency could lead to maintenance issues and visual discrepancies
- Examples included border-radius: 0.5rem, border-radius: 6px, and various other pixel-based values

#### Implementation Process
1. Comprehensive audit
   - Performed a thorough review of CSS files to identify all remaining hardcoded values
   - Categorized the values by their purpose and visual size
   - Mapped each hardcoded value to the appropriate variable in our simplified spacing system

2. Systematic replacement
   - Updated border-radius values to use appropriate spacing variables:
     - 0.5rem → var(--space-sm)
     - 0.375rem → var(--space-xs)
     - 6px → var(--space-xs)
     - 1rem → var(--space-sm)
   - Updated hardcoded padding values:
     - 1rem → var(--space-md)
     - 0.5rem → var(--space-xs) in media queries
   - Updated container padding rules in page.module.css
   - Ensured consistent mobile-specific styling with spacing variables
   - Replaced outdated var(--space-2xs) references with var(--space-xs)
   - Updated padding values for better consistency
   - Standardized hardcoded px values in media queries

3. Cross-component consistency
   - Ensured similar elements across different components use the same spacing variables
   - Standardized border-radius usage for similar UI elements
   - Created visual consistency through systematic variable application

4. Verification
   - Visually inspected all components after changes
   - Verified proper spacing relationships were maintained
   - Tested responsive behavior across viewport sizes
   - Confirmed theme compatibility in light and dark modes

#### Expected Resolution
- Complete elimination of hardcoded spacing values
- Consistent use of spacing variables across the entire application
- Improved maintainability through centralized spacing system
- Preserved visual design and component relationships
- All tests passing with updated values

#### Lessons Learned
- Even after a systematic refactoring, it's important to perform thorough audits
- Border-radius values are easily overlooked during spacing system migrations
- Visual consistency requires attention to detail across the entire component library
- A simplified spacing system is easier to apply consistently
- Standardizing border-radius values improves the coherence of the UI design
