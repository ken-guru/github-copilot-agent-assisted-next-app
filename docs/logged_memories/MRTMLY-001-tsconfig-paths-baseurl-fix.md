### Issue: TypeScript Path Resolution Configuration
**Date:** 2023-11-15
**Tags:** #configuration #typescript #path-resolution
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Error message: "Missing baseUrl in compilerOptions. tsconfig-paths will be skipped"
- The project was using tsconfig-paths but didn't have the required baseUrl configuration
- This prevented proper path resolution for non-relative imports

#### Debug Process
1. Identified the root cause
   - The tsconfig-paths package requires baseUrl to be set in tsconfig.json
   - Without baseUrl, it cannot properly resolve path aliases
   - Error message clearly indicated the issue

2. Solution implementation
   - Added baseUrl: "." to compilerOptions in tsconfig.json
   - This sets the project root as the base directory for imports

#### Resolution
- Added the required baseUrl configuration in tsconfig.json
- This enables tsconfig-paths to properly resolve module paths
- Path resolution will now work as expected

#### Lessons Learned
- When using path aliases and tsconfig-paths, always ensure baseUrl is configured
- The baseUrl is a fundamental configuration for TypeScript's module resolution
- Clear error messages can significantly speed up debugging process
