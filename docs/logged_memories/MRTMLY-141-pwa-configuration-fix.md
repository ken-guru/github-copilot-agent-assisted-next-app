### Issue: Progressive Web App Configuration Debugging Session
**Date:** 2023-10-26
**Tags:** #debugging #pwa #service-worker #manifest #offline
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Application showing 404 error on http://localhost:3000/
- Service worker registration failing with 404 errors
- Nothing being downloaded to local storage
- Missing PWA configuration files
- No manifest.json file despite being referenced in layout.tsx
- No app icons available

#### Debug Process
1. Initial investigation
   - Found references to non-existent manifest.json in layout.tsx
   - Service worker registration in page.tsx not effective
   - Missing app icons referenced in the non-existent manifest
   - Incorrect service worker configuration

2. Test-driven development approach
   - Created tests to verify manifest.json file existence and structure
   - Added tests for service worker functionality
   - Identified missing components in PWA configuration

3. Solution implementation
   - Created proper manifest.json file with all required fields
   - Added app icons in correct sizes (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon)
   - Moved service worker registration to layout.tsx using Next.js Script component
   - Improved service worker caching strategies:
     - Cache-first for static assets
     - Network-first with cache fallback for navigation requests
   - Added offline support with fallback pages
   - Implemented service worker update notification system

4. Error mitigation
   - Added proper error handling in service worker fetch events
   - Created offline placeholders for images
   - Improved service worker lifecycle management with skipWaiting and clients.claim
   - Fixed scope issues with service worker registration

#### Resolution
- Created proper PWA configuration with manifest.json
- Added required app icons for various platforms
- Implemented correct service worker registration in layout.tsx
- Enhanced service worker with proper caching strategies and offline support
- Added user notification for available updates
- Fixed 404 errors by ensuring all referenced files exist

#### Lessons Learned
- PWA configuration requires multiple coordinated components:
  - Web app manifest (manifest.json)
  - Service worker registration
  - Proper app icons in various sizes
- Service worker registration should be done at the layout level, not in individual pages
- Different resources need different caching strategies (HTML vs assets)
- Service workers need careful error handling and lifecycle management
- Testing PWA components requires specific mock setups
- Always verify all referenced files exist before deployment
- Service worker updates should be communicated to users
