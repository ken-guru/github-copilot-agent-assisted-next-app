### Issue: MRTMLY-045: Time Utils Test Import Error Fix
**Date:** 2025-05-15
**Tags:** #debugging #linting #typescript #time-utils #tests
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- TypeScript error in src/utils/testUtils/__tests__/timeUtils.test.ts:
  - Error: `"../timeUtils" has no exported member named 'formatTimeFromMs'. Did you mean 'formatTimeHHMMSS'?`
- The test file was trying to import and use a function `formatTimeFromMs` that doesn't exist
- The test is actually testing the `formatTimeHHMMSS` function but using an incorrect name

#### Debug Process
1. Identified the import mismatch issue
   - Found that the test file was importing `formatTimeFromMs` from "../timeUtils"
   - Confirmed that this function doesn't exist in the source file
   - Determined that the tests were meant for the existing `formatTimeHHMMSS` function

2. Reviewed the test implementation
   - Found test cases expecting a function that formats milliseconds to HH:MM:SS
   - Confirmed that these tests should use `formatTimeHHMMSS` with conversion from ms to seconds
   - Identified the proper implementation needed: manually convert ms to seconds before calling the function

#### Resolution
- Fixed the import by replacing `formatTimeFromMs` with `formatTimeHHMMSS`
- Updated test cases to manually convert milliseconds to seconds before calling `formatTimeHHMMSS`
- TypeScript now compiles without errors
- Tests still function as intended, verifying the same behavior

#### Lessons Learned
- When refactoring utilities, ensure test imports are updated to match new function names
- Descriptive function naming is important to indicate input type (seconds vs milliseconds)
- Consider adding utility functions explicitly for millisecond inputs to improve API clarity
- Be careful when renaming functions to ensure all references are updated
