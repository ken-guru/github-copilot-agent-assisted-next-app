# MRTMLY-006: Mobile-First CSS Variables Implementation

**Date:** 2023-07-11
**Tags:** #mobile #css #responsive #accessibility
**Status:** Completed

## Initial State
- Mobile UI improvements were planned but lacked consistent sizing and spacing
- No centralized system for responsive design attributes
- Touch targets may not have met accessibility standards
- Animation and transition timings were inconsistent across components

## Implementation Process

### 1. Research & Planning
- Researched best practices for mobile UI development
- Reviewed WCAG 2.1 requirements for touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Analyzed Apple Human Interface Guidelines for ideal touch targets (48px)
- Determined a comprehensive set of variables needed for the application

### 2. Variable Categories Definition
Created a structured system of variables covering:
- Spacing (margins, paddings, gaps)
- Border radius values
- Touch target sizes
- Typography scales (mobile and desktop)
- Layout dimensions
- Z-index management
- Animation timings
- Reduced motion accommodations

### 3. Testing Approach
- Created tests to verify all variables are defined correctly
- Ensured touch target variables meet accessibility standards
- Verified responsive adjustments at different breakpoints
- Confirmed reduced motion preferences are respected

### 4. Responsive Adjustments
- Implemented media queries to adjust spacing at different breakpoints
- Created separate typography scales for mobile and desktop
- Added conditional values for reduced motion preferences
- Ensured layout dimensions adapt to different viewport sizes

## Implementation Details

### 1. Spacing System
Created a geometric scale for consistent spacing:
- xs: 4px
- sm: 8px
- md: 16px → 20px (tablet) → 24px (desktop)
- lg: 24px → 28px (tablet) → 32px (desktop)
- xl: 32px → 40px (tablet) → 48px (desktop)

### 2. Touch Target Sizes
Implemented accessibility-focused target sizes:
- `--touch-target-min: 44px` (WCAG 2.1 minimum)
- `--touch-target-ideal: 48px` (Apple HIG recommendation)
- `--touch-target-large: 56px` (For primary actions)

### 3. Typography System
Developed typographic scales for mobile and desktop:
- Mobile starts smaller and has a narrower range
- Desktop has a wider range for more dramatic hierarchy
- Both scales use rem units for accessibility

### 4. Animation Timings
Standardized transition speeds:
- Fast: 150ms (micro-interactions)
- Normal: 300ms (standard transitions)
- Slow: 500ms (emphasis animations)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Testing CSS Variables
Since Jest doesn't fully support getComputedStyle for CSS variables, we had to implement a workaround by:
- Adding variables directly to test style elements
- Verifying string content rather than computed values

### Challenge 2: Responsive Values
CSS variables don't automatically change with media queries, requiring:
- Explicitly redefining variables within media query blocks
- Careful management of cascade and specificity

### Challenge 3: Supporting Reduced Motion
We needed to respect user preferences for reduced motion:
- Added media query to detect prefers-reduced-motion
- Set transition speeds to 0ms when reduced motion is preferred

## Lessons Learned

1. **CSS Variables Enhance Maintainability**: Having a central source of design tokens makes the system much easier to maintain and update.

2. **Mobile-First Requires Planning**: Starting with mobile sizes and scaling up requires careful planning of how variables change across breakpoints.

3. **Accessibility First**: Setting minimum sizes based on accessibility standards from the beginning ensures compliant components.

4. **Test Adaptations**: Testing CSS requires different approaches than testing JavaScript functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Use these variables in the TouchableButton component
2. Integrate with existing theme system
3. Update component styles to use the new variables
4. Create documentation for the design system
