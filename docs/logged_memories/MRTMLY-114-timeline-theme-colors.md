### Issue: MRTMLY-026: Timeline Component Theme Color Update Bug
**Date:** 2025-03-31
**Tags:** #bug-fix #theme #dark-mode #timeline #regression
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Timeline component displaying incorrect colors when theme is changed
- Background color not updating properly in dark mode
- Activity markers showing wrong contrast in dark theme
- Regression introduced after recent theme system updates

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated Timeline component theme implementation
   - Found direct color references instead of CSS variables
   - Identified missing theme context subscription
   - Determined React render cycle timing issue with theme changes

2. Solution attempts
   - Updated direct color references to use CSS variables
     - Changed hardcoded color values to var(--theme-color-*)
     - Outcome: Improved but still visual glitches during transition
     - Issue: Component not re-rendering on theme change

   - Added theme context integration
     - Subscribed component to theme context changes
     - Added useEffect hook to force re-render on theme change
     - Outcome: Better but timeline markers still inconsistent
     - Why: SVG elements needed special handling for theme

   - Implemented comprehensive theme handling
     - Refactored SVG elements to use CSS variables
     - Added proper cleanup for theme change listeners
     - Created dedicated theme transition for Timeline
     - Outcome: Successful transition with consistent appearance

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Full CSS variable implementation for all colors
  - React context subscription with proper cleanup
  - Special handling for SVG elements
  - Added test cases specifically for theme transitions
- Timeline now displays correctly in both themes with smooth transitions

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - SVG elements require special consideration for theme handling
  - Theme changes should trigger consistent re-renders
  - Always test components in both themes after any visual changes
- Future considerations:
  - Create a theme testing utility for all visual components
  - Consider using a design token system for better theme consistency
  - Add visual regression tests for theme transitions
