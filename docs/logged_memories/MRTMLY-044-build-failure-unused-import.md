### Issue: MRTMLY-044: Build Failure Due to Unused Import
**Date:** 2023-10-31
**Tags:** #debugging #build-failure #linting #time-utils
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Build failing during the deployment process with an ESLint error
- Error message: `'mainFormatTimeFromMs' is defined but never used. @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
- The error occurs in the `src/utils/testUtils/timeUtils.ts` file

#### Debug Process
1. Examined the source file to identify the issue
   - Located an import statement including `formatTimeFromMs as mainFormatTimeFromMs`
   - Confirmed this imported function wasn't being used anywhere in the file
   - Established that this was causing an ESLint error blocking the build

2. Investigated the context of time utilities
   - Found evidence of a previous refactoring/consolidation of time utilities (MRTMLY-038)
   - Determined that the unused import was likely a leftover from that consolidation
   - Checked if removing the import would cause any regressions

#### Resolution
- Removed the unused import `formatTimeFromMs as mainFormatTimeFromMs` from the import statement
- Kept other imports that are actively being used
- This simple change resolved the ESLint error and should allow the build to complete successfully

#### Lessons Learned
- During refactoring operations that involve modifying imports, ensure all imports are either used or removed
- ESLint rules can catch potential issues such as unused imports, which helps maintain code quality
- Unused imports can sometimes indicate incomplete refactoring and should be treated as warnings of potential issues
- Regular linting in the development environment can prevent these issues from appearing during deployment
