### Issue: MRTMLY-015: Timeline Component Test Suite Memory Leak and Failures
**Date:** 2025-03-03
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #timeline #memory-leak #jest
**Status:** Resolved

#### Initial State
- Timeline component test suite showing intermittent failures
- Console warnings about memory leaks in test environment
- Tests pass individually but fail when run as part of the full suite
- Error: "Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component"

#### Debug Process
1. Investigated test setup and teardown
   - Found missing cleanup in useEffect hooks
   - Identified setInterval references not being cleared
   - Determined some event listeners remained after component unmounting

2. Solution attempts
   - Added explicit cleanup in test afterEach blocks
     - Manually cleared intervals and timeouts
     - Outcome: Improved but still occasional failures
     - Issue: Core problem was in the component itself, not the tests

   - Refactored Timeline component useEffect cleanup
     - Added proper return functions to all useEffect hooks
     - Ensured all intervals and timeouts were cleared
     - Outcome: Memory leak warnings resolved but still test instability
     - Why: Race conditions in the test execution

   - Implemented test isolation and async handling
     - Added proper async/await pattern to tests
     - Used jest.useFakeTimers() to control time-based functionality
     - Outcome: Tests now stable and reliable
     - Added act() wrapper for state updates in tests

#### Resolution
- Final solution implemented:
  - Comprehensive cleanup in all useEffect hooks
  - Proper clearInterval/clearTimeout calls
  - Event listener cleanup for all addEventListener calls
  - Enhanced test structure with proper async testing patterns
  - Isolated tests to prevent cross-test contamination
- All Timeline tests now pass consistently in isolation and as part of the full suite

#### Lessons Learned
- Key insights:
  - Always include cleanup function in useEffect hooks with timers or listeners
  - Test each component in isolation to identify specific failure points
  - Use Jest's timer mocking capabilities for time-dependent components
- Future considerations:
  - Create a utility for standardized timer management
  - Consider using React Testing Library's cleanup utilities more extensively
  - Add memory profiling to CI/CD pipeline to catch future memory leaks
