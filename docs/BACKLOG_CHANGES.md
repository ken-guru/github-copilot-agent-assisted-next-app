# Cross-Device Toast Message Integration

## Context
This backlog item builds upon the planned "Mobile Layout Optimization for Toast Message Display" by extending the toast notification system to benefit all screen sizes, not just mobile layouts.

- **Components involved**: UpdateNotification component, ProgressBar component, page layout CSS
- **Current limitations**: The current plan addresses toast message space on mobile but doesn't provide a unified approach across all screen sizes
- **User needs**: Consistent notification experience regardless of device size with optimized layouts for each form factor

**Note**: Review and update this backlog item after implementing the mobile-specific layout changes to ensure alignment with the chosen implementation approach.

## Requirements

1. Unified Toast Notification System
   - Create a consistent notification position across all breakpoints
   - Implement standard styling, animations, and behavior regardless of screen size
   - Ensure proper stacking behavior when multiple notifications appear
   - Develop a systematic approach to notification lifecycle management

2. Desktop-Specific Layout Optimizations
   - Consider removing or redesigning the Progress element for desktop views
   - Leverage the more detailed Timeline visualization on larger screens
   - Position toast messages in a non-intrusive location (bottom-right recommended)
   - Ensure proper z-index stacking for layered elements

3. Component Architecture Updates
   - Create a Toast context provider for application-wide notification management
   - Implement a notification queue system
   - Support multiple notification types (success, error, warning, info)
   - Provide accessible notification patterns with proper ARIA roles

## Technical Guidelines
- Implement a CSS variable system for notification positioning, sizing, and spacing
- Use React Context API for notification state management
- Consider a mobile-first, progressive enhancement approach
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all notification components
- Implement proper focus management for notifications
- Use semantic HTML for notification components
- Maintain theme compatibility for all notification states

## Expected Outcome

User perspective:
- Consistent notification experience across all devices
- Clear visual hierarchy between content and system messages
- Non-disruptive notifications that don't interfere with primary tasks
- Appropriate notification positioning based on screen size

Technical perspective:
- Clean component architecture for notification management
- Simplified styling with shared CSS variables
- Improved separation of concerns between components
- Reduced code duplication across breakpoints
- Better maintainability through centralized notification logic

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Toast notification system works consistently across all breakpoints
- [ ] Desktop layout optimization provides clean, non-redundant UI
- [ ] Component architecture allows easy notification triggering from anywhere
- [ ] CSS variable system properly handles all screen sizes
- [ ] Theme compatibility verified in light and dark modes
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (focus management, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Visual regression testing confirms no layout issues
- [ ] Performance testing shows no negative impact from the notification system
