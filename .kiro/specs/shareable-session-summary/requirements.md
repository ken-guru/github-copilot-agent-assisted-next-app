# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to share their completed session summaries with others through unique URLs. When a user completes a time tracking session, they can generate a shareable link that displays their session data (activities, durations, timeline) in a read-only format. The shared summaries will be stored using Vercel Blob storage (native to Vercel, no external signup required) and accessed via UUID-based URLs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has completed a time tracking session, I want to generate a shareable URL for my session summary, so that I can share my productivity data with colleagues, clients, or for personal record-keeping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a session THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Share Session Summary"
2. WHEN a user clicks "Share Session Summary" THEN the system SHALL generate a unique UUID for the session
3. WHEN the UUID is generated THEN the system SHALL store the session data in Vercel storage with the UUID as the key
4. WHEN the session data is stored THEN the system SHALL provide a shareable URL in the format `/shared/{uuid}`
5. WHEN the shareable URL is generated THEN the system SHALL display it to the user with copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As someone who receives a shared session summary URL, I want to view the session data in a clean, read-only format, so that I can understand the shared productivity information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a `/shared/{uuid}` URL THEN the system SHALL retrieve the session data from storage
2. IF the UUID exists in storage THEN the system SHALL display the session summary in a read-only format
3. IF the UUID does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a "Session not found" error page
4. WHEN displaying a shared session THEN the system SHALL show all activities, durations, and timeline visualization
5. WHEN displaying a shared session THEN the system SHALL NOT allow any editing or modification of the data
6. WHEN displaying a shared session THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp of when the session was completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the shared sessions to be stored efficiently and securely, so that the feature scales well and protects user data appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL use Vercel Blob storage for persistence (unless specific technical limitations require an alternative)
2. WHEN generating UUIDs THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
3. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL include metadata (creation timestamp, expiration)
4. WHEN a shared session is older than 90 days THEN the system SHALL automatically expire/delete it
5. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL sanitize any potentially sensitive information
6. WHEN retrieving session data THEN the system SHALL validate the UUID format before querying storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user sharing session summaries, I want control over the privacy and lifecycle of my shared data, so that I can manage what information remains accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing a session THEN the user SHALL be informed that the link will expire after 90 days
2. WHEN a user creates multiple shared sessions THEN each SHALL have its own unique UUID
3. WHEN displaying the shareable URL THEN the system SHALL include a warning about data privacy
4. WHEN a shared session expires THEN visitors SHALL see an appropriate "expired" message
5. IF implemented THEN the system MAY provide an option to delete a shared session before expiration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want the sharing feature to integrate seamlessly with existing components, so that it maintains code quality and user experience consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the share feature THEN it SHALL reuse existing Summary component styling and layout
2. WHEN displaying shared sessions THEN they SHALL use the same theme system as the main application
3. WHEN adding share functionality THEN it SHALL follow the existing error handling patterns
4. WHEN implementing storage operations THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and retry logic
5. WHEN adding new routes THEN they SHALL follow the existing Next.js App Router conventions
