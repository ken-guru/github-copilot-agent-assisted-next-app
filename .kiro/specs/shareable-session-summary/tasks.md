# Implementation Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Quality Gates

**Before marking any task as completed, ALL of the following checks MUST pass:**

1. **Tests**: `npm test` - All tests must pass
2. **Linting**: `npm run lint` - No ESLint errors or warnings
3. **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` - No TypeScript compilation errors
4. **Build**: `npm run build` - Application must build successfully

**Failure to meet these requirements will cause GitHub checks and Vercel deployment to fail. No task should be considered complete until all quality gates pass.**

- `test:` for test additions
- Use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain what was implemented
- Make granular commits for each major component or functionality
- Include relevant task numbers in commit descriptions when helpful
