# Implementation Plan

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: Quality Gates & Commits

**Before marking any task as completed, ALL of the following steps MUST be completed IN ORDER:**

### 1. Quality Gates (ALL must pass):
1. **Tests**: `npm test` - All tests must pass
2. **Linting**: `npm run lint` - No ESLint errors or warnings
3. **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` - No TypeScript compilation errors
4. **Build**: `npm run build` - Application must build successfully

### 2. Commit Requirement (MANDATORY):
**EVERY task MUST end with a git commit using the exact commit message specified in the task.**

**Example workflow for each task:**
```bash
# 1. Implement the task
# 2. Run quality gates
npm test && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run build

# 3. ALWAYS commit with the specified message
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add SharedSummary component for read-only session display"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è NO TASK IS COMPLETE WITHOUT BOTH QUALITY GATES AND THE COMMIT STEP.**

**Failure to meet these requirements will cause GitHub checks and Vercel deployment to fail. The commit step ensures proper version control and deployment tracking.**

## Commit Strategy & Requirements

### üö® MANDATORY COMMIT PROCESS FOR EVERY TASK:

**Each task MUST be completed with these exact steps:**

1. **Implement the task requirements**
2. **Run ALL quality gates**: `npm test && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run build`
3. **COMMIT with the exact message specified**: `git add . && git commit -m "[exact message from task]"`

### Commit Message Format:
Each task includes a specific commit message following conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `test:` for test additions
- Use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain what was implemented
- Make granular commits for each major component or functionality
- Include relevant task numbers in commit descriptions when helpful

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDER:
**NO TASK IS COMPLETE WITHOUT THE COMMIT STEP. This ensures:**
- Proper version control tracking
- Deployment pipeline triggers
- Code review and collaboration
- Rollback capability if needed

**If you complete a task but forget to commit, the task is NOT finished and must be marked as incomplete until the commit is made.**
