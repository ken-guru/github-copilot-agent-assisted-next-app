# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the Mr. Timely application following Material 3 Expressive design principles as outlined by Google. The goal is to create a more dynamic, personalized, and expressive user interface that maintains all existing functionality while introducing modern design patterns including enhanced typography, refined color systems, improved component shapes, and more engaging interactions. This is purely a visual and interaction design effort - no application logic, data handling, or core functionality will be modified. The redesign will transform the current Bootstrap-based interface into a Material 3 Expressive experience that feels fresh, modern, and delightful to use while preserving all current features and workflows.
