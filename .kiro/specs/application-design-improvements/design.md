# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the transformation of Mr. Timely from its current Bootstrap-based interface to a Material 3 Expressive design system. The redesign will maintain all existing functionality while introducing Google's latest design language that emphasizes personality, expressiveness, and dynamic visual elements. The design will create a more engaging and delightful user experience through enhanced typography, organic shapes, dynamic color systems, and fluid animations.

## Architecture

### Design System Foundation

The new design will be built on Material 3 Expressive design tokens and principles:

- **Typography System**: Implementation of Material 3 Expressive type scale with dynamic sizing and expressive font weights
- **Color System**: Dynamic color generation with tonal palettes, semantic color roles, and theme-aware adaptation
- **Shape Language**: Organic and varied corner radius system moving beyond uniform rounded corners
- **Motion System**: Purposeful animations with shared element transitions and contextual easing
- **Component Library**: Material 3 Expressive components that replace current Bootstrap elements

### Technical Implementation Strategy

The design will be implemented by:
1. Creating a new CSS design token system based on Material 3 Expressive specifications
2. Gradually replacing Bootstrap components with custom Material 3 Expressive implementations
3. Maintaining existing React component structure while updating styling and interaction patterns
4. Implementing CSS custom properties for dynamic theming and color adaptation
5. Adding CSS animations and transitions for Material 3 Expressive motion patterns

## Data Models

### Design Token System

```typescript
interface MaterialExpressiveTokens {
  // Typography tokens
  typography: {
    displayLarge: TypographyToken;
    displayMedium: TypographyToken;
    displaySmall: TypographyToken;
    headlineLarge: TypographyToken;
    headlineMedium: TypographyToken;
    headlineSmall: TypographyToken;
    titleLarge: TypographyToken;
    titleMedium: TypographyToken;
    titleSmall: TypographyToken;
    bodyLarge: TypographyToken;
    bodyMedium: TypographyToken;
    bodySmall: TypographyToken;
    labelLarge: TypographyToken;
    labelMedium: TypographyToken;
    labelSmall: TypographyToken;
  };
  
  // Color tokens
  colors: {
    primary: ColorToken;
    onPrimary: ColorToken;
    primaryContainer: ColorToken;
    onPrimaryContainer: ColorToken;
    secondary: ColorToken;
    onSecondary: ColorToken;
    secondaryContainer: ColorToken;
    onSecondaryContainer: ColorToken;
    tertiary: ColorToken;
    onTertiary: ColorToken;
    tertiaryContainer: ColorToken;
    onTertiaryContainer: ColorToken;
    surface: ColorToken;
    onSurface: ColorToken;
    surfaceVariant: ColorToken;
    onSurfaceVariant: ColorToken;
    outline: ColorToken;
    outlineVariant: ColorToken;
  };
  
  // Shape tokens
  shapes: {
    cornerNone: ShapeToken;
    cornerExtraSmall: ShapeToken;
    cornerSmall: ShapeToken;
    cornerMedium: ShapeToken;
    cornerLarge: ShapeToken;
    cornerExtraLarge: ShapeToken;
    cornerFull: ShapeToken;
  };
  
  // Motion tokens
  motion: {
    easing: {
      standard: string;
      emphasized: string;
      decelerated: string;
      accelerated: string;
    };
    duration: {
      short1: string;
      short2: string;
      short3: string;
      short4: string;
      medium1: string;
      medium2: string;
      medium3: string;
      medium4: string;
      long1: string;
      long2: string;
      long3: string;
      long4: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### Component State Models

```typescript
interface MaterialExpressiveComponentState {
  elevation: 'level0' | 'level1' | 'level2' | 'level3' | 'level4' | 'level5';
  state: 'enabled' | 'disabled' | 'hovered' | 'focused' | 'pressed' | 'dragged';
  colorRole: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary' | 'surface' | 'background';
  shape: 'none' | 'extraSmall' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'extraLarge' | 'full';
}
```

## Error Handling

### Design System Fallbacks

- **Color System Fallbacks**: If dynamic color generation fails, fallback to predefined Material 3 Expressive color palettes
- **Typography Fallbacks**: Progressive enhancement for typography with fallbacks to system fonts if custom fonts fail to load
- **Animation Fallbacks**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion and provide static alternatives
- **Theme Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation to light theme if theme detection or switching fails

### Component Error States

- **Loading States**: Material 3 Expressive skeleton screens and progress indicators during content loading
- **Empty States**: Expressive empty state illustrations and messaging that guide users toward action
- **Validation States**: Clear and expressive form validation with contextual color and animation feedback
- **Network Error States**: Friendly error messages with expressive iconography and recovery actions

## Testing Strategy

- **Component Screenshots**: Automated visual testing of all Material 3 Expressive components in different states
- **Theme Testing**: Verification of proper color adaptation across light and dark themes
- **Responsive Testing**: Visual validation across different screen sizes and orientations
- **Animation Testing**: Verification of smooth transitions and proper motion implementation

### Accessibility Testing

- **Color Contrast**: Automated testing to ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Focus Management**: Keyboard navigation testing with proper focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Verification of proper semantic markup and ARIA labels
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Testing of reduced motion preferences and fallback experiences

### Cross-Browser Testing

- **Modern Browser Support**: Testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Mobile Browser Testing**: Verification on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Feature Detection**: Progressive enhancement testing for CSS features
- **Performance Testing**: Animation performance testing across different devices

### User Experience Testing
