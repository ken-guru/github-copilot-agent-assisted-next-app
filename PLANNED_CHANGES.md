After examining the codebase, I've identified a key area that could benefit from refactoring: the useActivityState hook. This hook contains complex state management logic that would be easier to work with if restructured. Here are the specific issues and recommendations:

Complex Areas That Need Refactoring

1. useActivityState Hook - State Management
The useActivityState hook is overly complex with:

- Multiple interrelated state variables (9 separate state variables)
- Complex completion logic spread across multiple functions
- Large useEffect dependency arrays that make it difficult to track state changes

Current implementation issues:

- The hook manages too many responsibilities at once
- The logic for determining when all activities are completed is complex and scattered
- Testing is complex, requiring many steps to simulate different activity statuses

2. Activity Completion Logic
The most complex part is determining when all activities are considered completed. The current logic checks multiple conditions:

```
// Mark as completed when:
// 1. No current activities in the set
// 2. No current activity running
// 3. If any activities are available (not removed):
//    - All available activities must be started and completed
//    - All unstarted activities must be removed
// 4. If NO activities are available:
//    - At least one activity must have been started and completed
```

This is embedded in a large useEffect with 7 dependencies, making it hard to track state changes.

Suggested Refactoring Approach

1. Split the Hook into Smaller Hooks
I recommend splitting useActivityState into smaller, more focused hooks:

    1. useActivityCollection - For managing the collection of activities
    2. useActivityExecution - For handling activity start/completion
    3. useTimelineEntries - For timeline entry management
    4. useActivityCompletion - For completion status logic

2. Create a Reducer for Complex State Transitions
Replace multiple useState calls with a useReducer that handles related state changes together:

```
type ActivityAction = 
  | { type: 'ADD_ACTIVITY', activity: Activity }
  | { type: 'START_ACTIVITY', activityId: string }
  | { type: 'COMPLETE_ACTIVITY', activityId: string }
  | { type: 'REMOVE_ACTIVITY', activityId: string }
  | { type: 'RESET' }
```

This approach would make state transitions more predictable and easier to debug.

3. Extract Completion Logic into a Separate Function
Move the completion state determination logic to a pure function that takes the current state and returns if activities are completed:

```
function determineCompletionStatus(state: ActivityState): boolean {
  // Logic to determine if all activities are completed
}
```

This would make the logic more testable and easier to understand.

Benefits of Refactoring
    1. Improved readability - Smaller, focused hooks and functions will be easier to understand
    2. Better testability - Pure functions for completion logic can be tested in isolation
    3. Easier maintenance - Changes to one aspect won't require understanding the entire complex hook
    4. Better performance - More granular updates may reduce unnecessary re-renders

These refactoring suggestions maintain the current functionality while making the code more maintainable for the future.
